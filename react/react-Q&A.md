# Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. React and React DOM

### What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of applications efficiently. React is maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.

### What is React DOM?
React DOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods for rendering React components to the DOM. It acts as a bridge between React and the browser's DOM, enabling React to update the UI dynamically.


## 2. What are the main features of React compared to other similar libraries?

React stands out among similar libraries due to its unique features and design principles:

1. **Declarative UI**: React uses a declarative approach to build user interfaces, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.

2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Applications are built using reusable, self-contained components, promoting modularity and maintainability.

3. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates to the real DOM, improving performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.

4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React enforces a one-way data flow, making it easier to understand and debug the state of an application.

5. **JSX Syntax**: React introduces JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, improving readability and developer experience.

6. **Rich Ecosystem**: React has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, such as React Router for routing and Redux for state management, enabling developers to build complex applications efficiently.

7. **React Hooks**: Hooks provide a way to use state and other React features in functional components, simplifying code and reducing boilerplate.

8. **Cross-Platform Development**: React Native extends React's capabilities to mobile app development, allowing developers to build native apps for iOS and Android using the same principles.

9. **Community and Support**: React is maintained by Facebook and has a large, active community, ensuring regular updates, extensive documentation, and a wealth of third-party resources.

10. **Backward Compatibility**: React emphasizes backward compatibility, ensuring that updates do not break existing applications.

These features make React a powerful and flexible choice for building modern web and mobile applications.



## 3. Explain Virtual DOM

### What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. It is a key concept in React that enables efficient updates to the user interface by minimizing direct manipulations of the browser's DOM.

### How does it work?
1. **Initial Rendering**: When a React component is rendered, a Virtual DOM tree is created to represent the structure of the UI.
2. **State or Prop Changes**: When the state or props of a component change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree to reflect the updated UI.
3. **Diffing Algorithm**: React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one using a process called "reconciliation" to identify the differences (or "diffs").
4. **Batch Updates**: React calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM and applies them in a single batch, improving performance.

### Benefits of the Virtual DOM
1. **Performance Optimization**: By reducing direct interactions with the real DOM, React minimizes expensive DOM operations, leading to faster updates.
2. **Declarative UI**: Developers can focus on describing how the UI should look, and React handles the underlying updates efficiently.
3. **Cross-Platform Rendering**: The Virtual DOM enables React to render components not only in the browser but also on other platforms, such as mobile (React Native) or server-side environments.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example:
- When the button is clicked, the `count` state changes.
- React creates a new Virtual DOM tree to reflect the updated UI.
- React compares the new tree with the previous one, identifies that only the `<p>` element needs to be updated, and applies the change to the real DOM.

The Virtual DOM is a core feature that makes React applications fast, efficient, and easy to maintain.




## 4. What is JSX?

### What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize React components.

### Why use JSX?
JSX improves code readability and developer productivity by allowing you to write markup directly in your JavaScript code. It also enables powerful JavaScript expressions within the markup.

### How does JSX work?
JSX code is not valid JavaScript by itself. During the build process, tools like Babel transpile JSX into standard JavaScript function calls (`React.createElement`), which React uses to create and update the DOM.

### Example of JSX
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

In this example:
- The `<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>` line is JSX.
- The `{name}` expression is evaluated as JavaScript and inserted into the markup.

### Key Points about JSX
- JSX elements must have a single parent element.
- You can embed JavaScript expressions inside `{}`.
- JSX attributes use camelCase (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).

JSX is a core part of the React development experience, making UI code more expressive and maintainable.

### Can web browsers read JSX directly?

No, web browsers cannot read JSX directly. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML, but browsers do not understand it natively. Before running in the browser, JSX must be transpiled (converted) into standard JavaScript using tools like Babel. This transpilation process turns JSX into `React.createElement` calls, which browsers can execute as regular JavaScript.

**Summary:**  
- Browsers require JSX to be compiled to JavaScript.
- Build tools (like Babel) handle this conversion automatically in most React projects.



## 5. How do you create a React app?

The easiest way to create a new React application is by using the official tool called **Create React App**. This tool sets up a modern React project with a good default configuration.

### Steps to Create a React App

1. **Install Node.js**  
    Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

2. **Create a New App**  
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-app
    ```
    Replace `my-app` with your desired project name.

3. **Navigate to the Project Folder**
    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

4. **Start the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the app and open it in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Alternative: Using Vite

For a faster setup, you can use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Summary

- Use `npx create-react-app my-app` for a standard setup.
- Use Vite for a lightweight, fast alternative.
- Both methods provide a ready-to-use React development environment.



## 6. How do you create an event in React? What are synthetic events?

### Creating Events in React

In React, you handle events by adding event handler props (such as `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.) to your JSX elements. These handlers are passed as functions.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ClickButton() {
    const handleClick = (event) => {
        alert('Button clicked!');
    };

    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Click Me
        </button>
    );
}

export default ClickButton;
```
- The `onClick` prop attaches the `handleClick` function to the button's click event.

### What are Synthetic Events?

React wraps native browser events in a cross-browser wrapper called a **SyntheticEvent**. This ensures events behave consistently across different browsers.

**Key points about Synthetic Events:**
- Synthetic events normalize event properties and behavior.
- They have the same interface as native events (e.g., `event.target`, `event.type`).
- Synthetic events are pooled for performance, so their properties may be nullified after the event handler runs. If you need to access the event asynchronously, call `event.persist()`.

#### Example:
```jsx
function InputLogger() {
    const handleChange = (event) => {
        console.log('Input value:', event.target.value);
    };

    return <input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

**Summary:**
- Use event handler props (like `onClick`) to handle events in React.
- React uses SyntheticEvent to provide consistent event behavior across browsers.

## 7. What is the difference between the ES6 and ES5 standards?

**ES5 (ECMAScript 5)** and **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** are versions of the ECMAScript specification that define the standard for JavaScript. ES6 introduced significant new features and syntax improvements over ES5.

### Key Differences

| Symbol Type            | Not supported                            | New primitive type: `Symbol`                      |
| Map/Set                | Not supported                            | Native `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`         |

### Example

**ES5:**
```js
var name = 'Alice';
var greeting = 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
```

**ES6:**
```js
const name = 'Alice';
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

**Summary:**  
ES6 introduced modern syntax and features that make JavaScript more powerful, expressive, and easier to write and maintain compared to ES5.



## 2. React Hooks

React provides several built-in hooks to manage state, side effects, and other functionalities in functional components:

1. **useState**: Allows you to add state to functional components.
2. **useEffect**: Enables you to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching or subscriptions.
3. **useContext**: Provides access to the context value for the nearest matching `Context.Provider`.
4. **useReducer**: An alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic.
5. **useCallback**: Memoizes a callback function to prevent unnecessary re-creations.
6. **useMemo**: Memoizes a computed value to optimize performance.
7. **useRef**: Provides a mutable reference to a DOM element or a value that persists across renders.
8. **useImperativeHandle**: Customizes the instance value exposed when using `React.forwardRef`.
9. **useLayoutEffect**: Similar to `useEffect`, but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.
10. **useDebugValue**: Used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.
11. **useTransition**: Helps manage state transitions without blocking the UI.
12. **useDeferredValue**: Defers updating a value until the UI is less busy.
13. **useId**: Generates a unique ID for accessibility or other purposes.
14. **useActionState**: Manages state transitions for actions, providing a way to track the status of asynchronous operations like loading, success, or error.
15. **useSyncExternalStore**: Allows reading and subscribing to external stores, ensuring consistent updates for concurrent rendering.
16. **useOptimistic**: Provides a way to manage optimistic UI updates, enabling temporary state changes that can be reverted if needed.
17. **useInsertionEffect**: Runs synchronously before DOM mutations, useful for injecting styles or performing other critical updates.

## 3. What are State Hooks? [`useState`]

State hooks, such as `useState`, allow functional components in React to manage and persist state across renders. They provide a way to store and update values that influence the component's behavior or appearance. 

#### Example of `useState`:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Click me
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example:
- `useState(0)` initializes the `count` state variable with a value of `0`.
- `setCount` is a function used to update the `count` value.
- Clicking the button increments the `count` value, and the UI re-renders to reflect the change.

State hooks are a fundamental part of React's functional component paradigm, enabling developers to build dynamic and interactive UIs.


## 4. What are Context Hooks? [`useContext`]

Context hooks, such as `useContext`, allow functional components to access and consume context values without needing to wrap components in a `Context.Consumer`. This simplifies the process of sharing data, such as themes or user information, across the component tree.

#### Example of `useContext`:
```jsx
import React, { useContext, createContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

function ThemedButton() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

    return (
        <button style={{ backgroundColor: theme === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#FFF', color: theme === 'dark' ? '#FFF' : '#000' }}>
            I am a {theme} themed button
        </button>
    );
}

function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            <ThemedButton />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
}

export default App;
```

In this example:
- `createContext('light')` creates a context with a default value of `'light'`.
- `useContext(ThemeContext)` retrieves the current value of `ThemeContext`, which is `'dark'` in this case.
- The `ThemeContext.Provider` component wraps the `ThemedButton` component, providing the `'dark'` value to it.

Context hooks are particularly useful for avoiding "prop drilling" and managing global state in a React application.

## 5. What are Ref Hooks? [`useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`]

Ref hooks, such as `useRef` and `useImperativeHandle`, provide ways to interact with DOM elements or persist values across renders without causing re-renders.

### `useRef`
The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object that persists across renders. It is commonly used to reference DOM elements or store mutable values.

#### Example of `useRef`:
```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

    const focusInput = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
            <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus the input</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default TextInputWithFocusButton;
```

In this example:
- `useRef(null)` creates a reference object with an initial value of `null`.
- The `ref` attribute is assigned to the input element, allowing `inputRef.current` to point to the DOM node.
- Calling `inputRef.current.focus()` focuses the input element.

### `useImperativeHandle`
The `useImperativeHandle` hook customizes the instance value exposed when using `React.forwardRef`. It is useful for controlling what is accessible to parent components when a ref is passed.

#### Example of `useImperativeHandle`:
```jsx
import React, { useRef, useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';

const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
    const inputRef = useRef();

    useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
        focus: () => {
            inputRef.current.focus();
        },
        clear: () => {
            inputRef.current.value = '';
        },
    }));

    return <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />;
});

function ParentComponent() {
    const inputRef = useRef();

    return (
        <div>
            <CustomInput ref={inputRef} />
            <button onClick={() => inputRef.current.focus()}>Focus</button>
            <button onClick={() => inputRef.current.clear()}>Clear</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

In this example:
- `React.forwardRef` allows the `CustomInput` component to accept a `ref` from its parent.
- `useImperativeHandle` customizes the methods (`focus` and `clear`) exposed to the parent via the `ref`.
- The parent component can call these methods on the `CustomInput` component.

Ref hooks are powerful tools for managing DOM interactions and exposing imperative methods in React components.


## 6. What are Effect Hooks? [`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useInsertionEffect`]

Effect hooks, such as `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, and `useInsertionEffect`, allow functional components to perform side effects, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscribing to external systems.

### `useEffect`
The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after the render phase and can be used for tasks like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or updating the DOM.

#### Example of `useEffect`:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
            setSeconds((prev) => prev + 1);
        }, 1000);

        return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup on unmount
    }, []);

    return <p>Seconds elapsed: {seconds}</p>;
}

export default Timer;
```

In this example:
- The `useEffect` hook sets up an interval to update the `seconds` state every second.
- The cleanup function (`clearInterval`) ensures the interval is cleared when the component unmounts.

### `useLayoutEffect`
The `useLayoutEffect` hook is similar to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations and before the browser paints. It is useful for measuring DOM elements or making adjustments before the user sees the changes.

#### Example of `useLayoutEffect`:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useLayoutEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function LayoutEffectExample() {
    const [width, setWidth] = useState(0);
    const divRef = useRef();

    useLayoutEffect(() => {
        setWidth(divRef.current.offsetWidth);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div ref={divRef} style={{ width: '50%' }}>
            <p>Div width: {width}px</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default LayoutEffectExample;
```

In this example:
- `useLayoutEffect` measures the width of the `div` element after it is rendered but before the browser paints the screen.
- This ensures the width is accurate when displayed.

### `useInsertionEffect`
The `useInsertionEffect` hook runs synchronously before any DOM mutations. It is primarily used for injecting styles or performing critical updates that need to happen before rendering.

#### Example of `useInsertionEffect`:
```jsx
import React, { useInsertionEffect } from 'react';

function InsertionEffectExample() {
    useInsertionEffect(() => {
        const style = document.createElement('style');
        style.textContent = 'body { background-color: lightblue; }';
        document.head.appendChild(style);

        return () => {
            document.head.removeChild(style); // Cleanup on unmount
        };
    }, []);

    return <p>The background color is set using useInsertionEffect.</p>;
}

export default InsertionEffectExample;
```

In this example:
- `useInsertionEffect` injects a style tag into the document head before the DOM is updated.
- The cleanup function removes the style when the component unmounts.

Effect hooks provide powerful tools for managing side effects in React, with each hook tailored to specific timing and use cases.


## 7. What are Performance Hooks? [`useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`]

Performance hooks in React, such as `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useTransition`, and `useDeferredValue`, help optimize rendering and improve the responsiveness of applications by managing expensive computations, preventing unnecessary re-renders, and handling state transitions efficiently.

### `useMemo`
**What?**  
`useMemo` memoizes a computed value, ensuring it is only recalculated when its dependencies change.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function ExpensiveCalculation({ num }) {
    const computeFactorial = (n) => {
        console.log('Calculating factorial...');
        return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * computeFactorial(n - 1);
    };

    const factorial = useMemo(() => computeFactorial(num), [num]);

    return <p>Factorial of {num} is {factorial}</p>;
}
```

**When and Why?**  
Use `useMemo` when you have expensive computations that don't need to be recalculated on every render. It improves performance by avoiding redundant calculations.

---

### `useCallback`
**What?**  
`useCallback` memoizes a callback function, preventing it from being recreated unless its dependencies change.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function Button({ onClick }) {
    console.log('Button rendered');
    return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
}

function Parent() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = useCallback(() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1), []);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <Button onClick={increment} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

**When and Why?**  
Use `useCallback` when passing functions as props to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders of those components.

---

### `useTransition`
**What?**  
`useTransition` allows you to manage state transitions without blocking the UI, making the application feel more responsive.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function List({ items }) {
    return (
        <ul>
            {items.map((item, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{item}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
}

function App() {
    const [input, setInput] = useState('');
    const [list, setList] = useState([]);
    const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

    const handleChange = (e) => {
        const value = e.target.value;
        setInput(value);

        startTransition(() => {
            const filteredList = Array(10000)
                .fill(0)
                .map((_, i) => `Item ${i}`)
                .filter((item) => item.includes(value));
            setList(filteredList);
        });
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <input value={input} onChange={handleChange} />
            {isPending ? <p>Loading...</p> : <List items={list} />}
        </div>
    );
}
```

**When and Why?**  
Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates, such as filtering large lists, to keep the UI responsive during heavy computations.

---

### `useDeferredValue`
**What?**  
`useDeferredValue` defers updating a value until the UI is less busy, ensuring smoother interactions.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';

function List({ items }) {
    return (
        <ul>
            {items.map((item, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{item}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
}

function App() {
    const [input, setInput] = useState('');
    const deferredInput = useDeferredValue(input);

    const filteredList = Array(10000)
        .fill(0)
        .map((_, i) => `Item ${i}`)
        .filter((item) => item.includes(deferredInput));

    return (
        <div>
            <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
            <List items={filteredList} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

**When and Why?**  
Use `useDeferredValue` when you want to delay updates to derived values, such as filtered lists, to avoid blocking the main thread during user interactions.

---

Performance hooks are essential for optimizing React applications, ensuring smooth user experiences and efficient rendering.





## 8. Explain `useDebugValue`, `useReducer`, `useId`, `useActionState`, `useSyncExternalStore`, `useOptimistic`

### `useDebugValue`
**What?**  
`useDebugValue` is a hook used to display custom labels for custom hooks in React DevTools, making debugging easier.

**When and Why?**  
Use `useDebugValue` when creating custom hooks to provide meaningful information in React DevTools.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useState, useDebugValue } from 'react';

function useCustomHook(initialValue) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
    useDebugValue(value > 5 ? 'High' : 'Low');
    return [value, setValue];
}

function Component() {
    const [count, setCount] = useCustomHook(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

---

### `useReducer`
**What?**  
`useReducer` is a hook for managing complex state logic using a reducer function.

**When and Why?**  
Use `useReducer` when state transitions are complex or depend on the previous state.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            throw new Error();
    }
}

function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

---

### `useId`
**What?**  
`useId` generates unique IDs for accessibility or other purposes.

**When and Why?**  
Use `useId` when you need unique IDs for elements, especially in server-rendered applications.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useId } from 'react';

function Form() {
    const id = useId();

    return (
        <div>
            <label htmlFor={`${id}-input`}>Name:</label>
            <input id={`${id}-input`} type="text" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

---

### `useActionState`
**What?**  
`useActionState` manages state transitions for asynchronous actions, such as loading, success, or error states.

**When and Why?**  
Use `useActionState` to track the status of async operations and provide feedback to users.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function useActionState() {
    const [state, setState] = useState('idle');

    const startAction = async (action) => {
        setState('loading');
        try {
            await action();
            setState('success');
        } catch {
            setState('error');
        }
    };

    return [state, startAction];
}

function App() {
    const [state, startAction] = useActionState();

    const handleClick = () => {
        startAction(() => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)));
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Start Action</button>
            <p>Status: {state}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

---

### `useSyncExternalStore`
**What?**  
`useSyncExternalStore` reads and subscribes to external stores, ensuring consistent updates for concurrent rendering.

**When and Why?**  
Use `useSyncExternalStore` when integrating external state management libraries with React.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

function useStore(store) {
    return useSyncExternalStore(
        store.subscribe,
        store.getState,
        store.getState // For server rendering
    );
}

function Counter({ store }) {
    const count = useStore(store);

    return <p>Count: {count}</p>;
}
```

---

### `useOptimistic`
**What?**  
`useOptimistic` manages optimistic UI updates, allowing temporary state changes that can be reverted if needed.

**When and Why?**  
Use `useOptimistic` for scenarios like form submissions or API calls where immediate feedback is needed.

**How?**  
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function useOptimistic(initialValue) {
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

    const updateOptimistically = (newValue, revert) => {
        const previousValue = state;
        setState(newValue);
        return () => setState(previousValue);
    };

    return [state, updateOptimistically];
}

function App() {
    const [value, updateOptimistically] = useOptimistic(0);

    const handleClick = () => {
        const revert = updateOptimistically(value + 1);
        setTimeout(() => revert(), 2000); // Revert after 2 seconds
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Value: {value}</p>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment Optimistically</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

--- 

These hooks provide advanced capabilities for debugging, state management, and performance optimization in React applications.

## 9. How to define a custom hook in React? Explain with example.

### What is a Custom Hook?
A custom hook is a JavaScript function that starts with the prefix `use` and allows you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components. Custom hooks enable you to extract and share logic without duplicating code.

### How to Define a Custom Hook?
To define a custom hook:
1. Create a function that starts with `use`.
2. Use built-in hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) inside the function to implement the desired logic.
3. Return the necessary values or functions from the custom hook.

### Example of a Custom Hook
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom Hook: useFetch
function useFetch(url) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            setLoading(true);
            try {
                const response = await fetch(url);
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                }
                const result = await response.json();
                setData(result);
            } catch (err) {
                setError(err.message);
            } finally {
                setLoading(false);
            }
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading, error };
}

// Component using the custom hook
function App() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

    return (
        <ul>
            {data.map((post) => (
                <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Custom Hook (`useFetch`)**:
   - Accepts a `url` parameter.
   - Uses `useState` to manage `data`, `loading`, and `error` states.
   - Uses `useEffect` to fetch data when the `url` changes.
   - Returns the `data`, `loading`, and `error` states to the component.

2. **Component (`App`)**:
   - Calls `useFetch` with a URL.
   - Displays a loading message, error message, or the fetched data based on the hook's returned values.

### Benefits of Custom Hooks:
- **Reusability**: Encapsulate logic and reuse it across multiple components.
- **Readability**: Simplify components by moving logic into hooks.
- **Testability**: Test hooks independently from components.

Custom hooks are a powerful way to share logic and keep your React codebase clean and maintainable.



## 10. What is Context in React? When and how would you use it?

### What is Context in React?

Context in React is a way to share values (such as data or functions) between components without having to pass props manually through every level of the component tree. It enables global-like state or configuration to be accessed by any component, no matter how deeply nested.

### When should you use Context?

- When you need to share data or functions across many components at different nesting levels.
- To avoid "prop drilling" (passing props through intermediate components that don't need them).
- Common use cases: themes, authentication status, user settings, language/localization, or any global data.

**Note:** Context is best for global or app-wide data. For frequent or complex state updates, consider state management libraries like Redux or Zustand.

### How to Implement Context in React (Step by Step)

#### 1. Create a Context

Use `React.createContext()` to create a context object.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light'); // 'light' is the default value
```

#### 2. Provide the Context Value

Wrap your component tree (or part of it) with the Context Provider and pass the value you want to share.

```jsx
function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            <Toolbar />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
}
```

#### 3. Consume the Context Value

Use the `useContext` hook (in functional components) to access the context value.

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

function Toolbar() {
    return <ThemedButton />;
}

function ThemedButton() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return (
        <button style={{
            background: theme === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#fff',
            color: theme === 'dark' ? '#fff' : '#333'
        }}>
            Theme is {theme}
        </button>
    );
}
```

#### 4. (Optional) Update Context Value

If you want to allow components to update the context value, provide a state and updater function via the provider:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
            <Toolbar />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
}

function ThemedButton() {
    const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return (
        <button
            onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')}
            style={{
                background: theme === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#fff',
                color: theme === 'dark' ? '#fff' : '#333'
            }}
        >
            Toggle Theme
        </button>
    );
}
```

### Summary

- Create a context with `createContext`.
- Wrap components with the Provider and pass the value.
- Use `useContext` to access the value in any descendant.
- Use context to avoid prop drilling and share global data across your app.





## 11. How do lists work in React? Why is there a need to use keys in Lists?

### How Lists Work in React

In React, you often need to render a collection of similar items, such as an array of objects or values. To do this, you typically use the JavaScript `map()` function to transform each item in the array into a React element.

#### Example:
```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

function NumberList() {
    return (
        <ul>
            {numbers.map((number) => (
                <li key={number}>{number}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
}
```
- Here, each number in the `numbers` array is rendered as an `<li>` element inside a `<ul>`.

### Why Use Keys in Lists?

**Keys** are special string attributes you must include when creating lists of elements in React. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, allowing for efficient updates and rendering.

#### Reasons for Using Keys:
- **Efficient Reconciliation:** Keys help React's diffing algorithm match elements between renders, minimizing DOM operations.
- **Stable Identity:** Keys give each element a stable identity, preventing issues like incorrect state or unexpected behavior during updates.
- **Performance:** Using unique keys improves rendering performance, especially in large lists.

#### Best Practices:
- Use a unique and stable value for the key (such as a database ID).
- Avoid using array indexes as keys if the list can change order or have items inserted/removed, as this can lead to bugs.

#### Example with Unique Keys:
```jsx
const todos = [
    { id: 1, text: 'Learn React' },
    { id: 2, text: 'Build a project' },
];

function TodoList() {
    return (
        <ul>
            {todos.map((todo) => (
                <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
}
```

**Summary:**  
- Lists in React are rendered by mapping arrays to elements.
- Keys are required to help React track and efficiently update list items.
- Always use unique, stable keys for list elements.



## 12. What are forms in React?

### What are Forms in React?
Forms in React are used to collect user input and handle user interactions such as text input, selections, and submissions. React provides a way to manage form data using component state, making form handling predictable and controlled.

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

- **Controlled Components:**  
    In controlled components, form data is handled by React state. The value of each input element is set by the state, and any changes update the state via event handlers.

- **Uncontrolled Components:**  
    In uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself. You access values using refs instead of state.

### Example: Controlled Form

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyForm() {
        const [name, setName] = useState('');

        const handleChange = (e) => setName(e.target.value);

        const handleSubmit = (e) => {
                e.preventDefault();
                alert(`Submitted name: ${name}`);
        };

        return (
                <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                        <label>
                                Name:
                                <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
                        </label>
                        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                </form>
        );
}

export default MyForm;
```

### Key Points

- Use `value` and `onChange` to control input fields.
- Handle form submission with `onSubmit` and prevent default browser behavior using `e.preventDefault()`.
- Controlled components make it easier to validate, format, or conditionally enable/disable form fields.

**Summary:**  
Forms in React are typically managed using state, making user input predictable and easy to validate or manipulate before submission.



## 13. What is Prop Drilling and how do you avoid it?

### What is Prop Drilling?

Prop drilling is the process of passing data from a parent component to deeply nested child components through intermediate components that do not need the data themselves. This can make the code harder to maintain and understand, especially as the component tree grows.

#### Example of Prop Drilling:
```jsx
function Grandparent() {
    const user = { name: 'Alice' };
    return <Parent user={user} />;
}

function Parent({ user }) {
    return <Child user={user} />;
}

function Child({ user }) {
    return <p>User: {user.name}</p>;
}
```
Here, the `user` prop is passed through `Parent` just to reach `Child`, even though `Parent` does not use it.

### How do you avoid Prop Drilling?

The most common way to avoid prop drilling is by using **React Context**. Context allows you to share values directly with any component in the tree, without passing props through every level.

#### Example using Context:
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const UserContext = createContext();

function Grandparent() {
    const user = { name: 'Alice' };
    return (
        <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
            <Parent />
        </UserContext.Provider>
    );
}

function Parent() {
    return <Child />;
}

function Child() {
    const user = useContext(UserContext);
    return <p>User: {user.name}</p>;
}
```
Now, `Child` can access `user` directly from context, and `Parent` does not need to pass it down.

### Other Solutions

- **State Management Libraries:** Tools like Redux, Zustand, or Recoil can help manage global state and avoid prop drilling.
- **Component Composition:** Sometimes, restructuring components or using render props can reduce the need for prop drilling.

**Summary:**  
Prop drilling occurs when props are passed through many layers of components. Use React Context or state management libraries to avoid it and keep your code clean and maintainable.



## 14. What is Webpack? What, why, when, and how?

### What is Webpack?
Webpack is a powerful module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and bundles them into optimized static assets for deployment.

### Why use Webpack?
- **Module Bundling:** Combines many files into a few optimized bundles.
- **Asset Management:** Handles not just JS, but also CSS, images, fonts, etc.
- **Code Splitting:** Loads only the code needed for a particular page, improving performance.
- **Development Tools:** Supports hot module replacement, source maps, and more.
- **Extensibility:** Highly configurable with plugins and loaders for custom workflows.

### When should you use Webpack?
- When building modern JavaScript applications (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
- When you need to bundle and optimize assets for production.
- When you want advanced features like code splitting, tree shaking, or custom build steps.

### How does Webpack work?
1. **Entry:** Define the entry point(s) for your application (e.g., `src/index.js`).
2. **Loaders:** Transform files (e.g., Babel for JS/JSX, CSS loaders for styles).
3. **Plugins:** Extend Webpack's capabilities (e.g., HTML generation, cleaning output folders).
4. **Output:** Specify where bundled files should be emitted (e.g., `dist/bundle.js`).

#### Example: Basic Webpack Configuration (`webpack.config.js`)
```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.jsx?$/,
                use: 'babel-loader',
                exclude: /node_modules/,
            },
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
            },
        ],
    },
    plugins: [
        // Add plugins here (e.g., HtmlWebpackPlugin)
    ],
    mode: 'development', // or 'production'
};
```

### Summary
Webpack is essential for modern web development, enabling efficient bundling, optimization, and management of application assets. Use it when you need a customizable build process for JavaScript projects.


## 15. What are the alternatives to Webpack?

**Summary:**  
Alternatives like Vite, Parcel, Rollup, and esbuild provide faster builds, simpler configuration, and modern features compared to Webpack. Choose the tool that best fits your project's needs and complexity.



## 16. Differentiate between controlled and uncontrolled components.

### Controlled Components

- **Definition:** In controlled components, form data is handled by the React component's state. The value of each input element is set by the state, and any changes are managed via event handlers.
- **How it works:** The component renders the input with a `value` prop and updates state on every change.
- **Benefits:** Easier to validate, conditionally enable/disable fields, and enforce input formats. State always reflects the current input value.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledInput() {
    const [value, setValue] = useState('');
    return (
        <input
            type="text"
            value={value}
            onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}
        />
    );
}
```

---

### Uncontrolled Components

- **Definition:** In uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself. You access the input value using a ref rather than React state.
- **How it works:** The component does not control the input's value. Instead, you read the value directly from the DOM when needed.
- **Benefits:** Useful for quick forms or integrating with non-React code. Less code for simple use cases.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledInput() {
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Input value: ${inputRef.current.value}`);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

---

### Key Differences

| Aspect                | Controlled Component                  | Uncontrolled Component              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Data Source           | React state                           | DOM (via refs)                      |
| Value Prop            | Required                              | Not required                        |
| onChange Handler      | Required                              | Optional                            |
| Validation            | Easy (in React)                       | Harder (manual, after submit)       |
| Use Case              | Complex forms, validation, dynamic UI | Simple forms, quick prototyping     |

**Summary:**  
Controlled components are preferred for most React forms due to better control and validation, while uncontrolled components are simpler for basic or legacy scenarios.



## 17. What is a dispatcher in React?

### What is a Dispatcher?

In React, a **dispatcher** is a function or mechanism responsible for sending actions or updates to a state management system. The term is most commonly associated with state management patterns like Flux, Redux, or the internal workings of React hooks such as `useReducer`.

### Dispatcher in Context of `useReducer`

When using the `useReducer` hook, the **dispatcher** is the `dispatch` function returned by the hook. This function is used to send actions to the reducer, which then updates the state based on the action type and payload.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>
                Increment
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```
- Here, `dispatch` is the dispatcher function that sends actions to the reducer.

### Dispatcher in Flux/Redux

In Flux or Redux architectures, the dispatcher is a central hub that manages all data flow in the application. Actions are dispatched to the dispatcher, which then notifies the appropriate stores to update their state.

### Summary

- A dispatcher is a function that sends actions or updates to a state management system.
- In React, the `dispatch` function from `useReducer` is a common example of a dispatcher.
- Dispatchers help manage state changes in a predictable and organized way.



## 18. What are the different side effects of a React component?

### What are Side Effects?

In React, a **side effect** is any operation that affects something outside the scope of the component function or interacts with the outside world. Side effects go beyond simply calculating and rendering UI—they include actions like data fetching, subscriptions, timers, and direct DOM manipulation.

### Common Types of Side Effects in React Components

1. **Data Fetching**
    - Making HTTP requests to load data from APIs.
    - Example: Fetching user data when a component mounts.

2. **Subscriptions**
    - Subscribing to external data sources (e.g., WebSocket, event listeners).
    - Example: Listening for window resize or custom events.

3. **Timers**
    - Setting up intervals or timeouts.
    - Example: Updating a clock every second.

4. **Manually Changing the DOM**
    - Directly manipulating DOM elements (rare in React, but sometimes necessary).
    - Example: Focusing an input or integrating with third-party libraries.

5. **Logging and Analytics**
    - Sending logs or analytics data when certain actions occur.
    - Example: Tracking page views or button clicks.

6. **Cleanup Operations**
    - Cleaning up subscriptions, timers, or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.
    - Example: Removing a window event listener when a component unmounts.

### How to Handle Side Effects in React

React provides hooks to manage side effects:

- **`useEffect`**: For most side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, timers, etc.).
- **`useLayoutEffect`**: For side effects that need to run synchronously after DOM mutations.
- **`useInsertionEffect`**: For injecting styles or critical updates before DOM mutations.

#### Example: Data Fetching Side Effect

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
     const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
          fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)
                .then(res => res.json())
                .then(data => setUser(data));
     }, [userId]);

     if (!user) return <p>Loading...</p>;
     return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

### Summary

Side effects in React include data fetching, subscriptions, timers, DOM manipulation, logging, and cleanup. They are managed using hooks like `useEffect` to ensure predictable and efficient updates.


## 19. What are the lifecycle steps in React?

### What is a Lifecycle in React?

The **lifecycle** of a React component refers to the sequence of methods and phases that a component goes through from creation (mounting), updating, and finally removal (unmounting) from the DOM. Understanding these steps helps manage side effects, data fetching, and cleanup.

### Lifecycle Phases in React (Functional Components)

With React Hooks, lifecycle management is handled using hooks like `useEffect`, but the conceptual phases remain:

1. **Mounting**  
    - The component is created and inserted into the DOM.
    - Equivalent to `componentDidMount` in class components.
    - Use `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])` for mount logic.

2. **Updating**  
    - The component re-renders due to changes in props or state.
    - Equivalent to `componentDidUpdate` in class components.
    - Use `useEffect(() => { ... }, [dependencies])` for update logic.

3. **Unmounting**  
    - The component is removed from the DOM.
    - Equivalent to `componentWillUnmount` in class components.
    - Use the cleanup function in `useEffect` for unmount logic.

### Example with `useEffect`

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     // Mounting and updating
     useEffect(() => {
          document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
          // Cleanup (unmounting)
          return () => {
                // Cleanup code here
          };
     }, [count]);

     return (
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Increment
          </button>
     );
}
```

### Lifecycle Methods in Class Components

For reference, class components have explicit lifecycle methods:

- **Mounting:** `constructor`, `componentDidMount`
- **Updating:** `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`
- **Unmounting:** `componentWillUnmount`
- **Error Handling:** `componentDidCatch`, `getDerivedStateFromError`

### Summary

React components go through mounting, updating, and unmounting phases. In functional components, these are managed with hooks like `useEffect`, allowing you to run code at specific points in the component's lifecycle.


## 20. What are Error Boundaries in React? What, When, How, Why?

### What are Error Boundaries?

Error boundaries are special React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app. They help prevent the whole UI from breaking due to errors in a part of the component tree.

### When should you use Error Boundaries?

Use error boundaries to gracefully handle unexpected errors in:
- Third-party components or libraries
- Complex or deeply nested component trees
- Areas where user input or data fetching may cause unpredictable failures

Error boundaries do **not** catch errors in:
- Event handlers
- Asynchronous code (e.g., `setTimeout`, `Promise`)
- Server-side rendering
- Errors thrown in the error boundary itself

### How do you implement an Error Boundary?

Error boundaries must be class components that implement either (or both) of these lifecycle methods:
- `static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`
- `componentDidCatch(error, info)`

#### Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
    }

    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        return { hasError: true };
    }

    componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        // Log error to an error reporting service
        console.error('ErrorBoundary caught an error:', error, info);
    }

    render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
            return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
    }
}

// Usage
function App() {
    return (
        <ErrorBoundary>
            <MyComponent />
        </ErrorBoundary>
    );
}
```

### Why use Error Boundaries?

- **User Experience:** Prevents the entire app from crashing due to errors in a single component.
- **Debugging:** Allows logging and tracking of errors for monitoring and debugging.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Displays a fallback UI so users can continue using unaffected parts of the app.

**Summary:**  
Error boundaries are React class components that catch rendering errors in their children, display a fallback UI, and help keep your app stable and user-friendly.



## 21. What are the rules to follow when using React Hooks?

React Hooks are powerful, but they come with a set of strict rules to ensure predictable behavior and correct state management. Breaking these rules can lead to bugs or unexpected results.

### The Rules of Hooks

1. **Only Call Hooks at the Top Level**
    - Do not call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
    - Always use Hooks at the top level of your React function so that Hooks are called in the same order on every render.

2. **Only Call Hooks from React Functions**
    - Call Hooks from React functional components or from custom Hooks.
    - Do not call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions, class components, or outside of a React component.

### Why These Rules?

- **Consistent Order:** React relies on the order of Hook calls to associate state and effects with components. Calling Hooks conditionally or inside loops breaks this order.
- **Component Context:** Hooks need to be called within the context of a React component to access the correct state and lifecycle.

### Example of Correct Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Top-level call

     useEffect(() => {
          document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
     }, [count]); // Top-level call

     return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>;
}
```

### Example of Incorrect Usage

```jsx
// ❌ Don't do this!
function BadExample({ items }) {
     if (items.length > 0) {
          // Hooks inside a condition (not allowed)
          const [selected, setSelected] = useState(items[0]);
     }
     // ...
}
```

### Linting

React provides an [ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) to automatically check for violations of these rules.

**Summary:**  
- Call Hooks only at the top level of React functions.
- Only call Hooks from React components or custom Hooks.
- Follow these rules to ensure reliable and bug-free React applications.


## 22. What are the components in React?

### What are Components?

Components are the fundamental building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that manage their own structure, logic, and styling. Components make it easy to build complex user interfaces by composing smaller, manageable pieces.

### Types of Components

1. **Function Components**
    - Defined as JavaScript functions.
    - Use React Hooks for state and lifecycle features.
    - Most common in modern React development.

    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';

    function Welcome(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
    }
    ```

2. **Class Components**
    - Defined as ES6 classes extending `React.Component`.
    - Use lifecycle methods and `this.state` for state management.
    - Less common in new code, but still supported.

    ```jsx
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    class Welcome extends Component {
        render() {
            return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
        }
    }
    ```

### Component Structure

- **Props:** Inputs to a component, passed as attributes.
- **State:** Internal data managed by the component (using hooks or `this.state`).
- **Lifecycle:** Methods or hooks to run code at specific points (mount, update, unmount).

### Composing Components

Components can be nested and composed to build complex UIs:

```jsx
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Welcome name="Alice" />
            <Welcome name="Bob" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Summary

- Components are reusable UI building blocks in React.
- They can be function or class components.
- Components receive props, manage state, and can be composed together to create complex interfaces.



## 23. What is the use of `render()` in React? Is it used in functional components?

### What is `render()` in React?

The `render()` method is a required lifecycle method in **class components**. It returns the JSX (or React elements) that describe what should appear on the screen. React calls `render()` to determine the UI output for the component.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    }
}
```
- Here, the `render()` method returns a heading element.

### Is `render()` used in functional components?

No, **functional components do not use the `render()` method**. Instead, the function itself returns the JSX directly.

#### Example:
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```
- The function body returns the JSX, so no `render()` method is needed.

### Summary

- `render()` is only used in class components to define the UI.
- Functional components return JSX directly and do not use `render()`.



## 24. What is a state in React? What, when, how, why?

### What is State in React?

**State** is a built-in object in React components that allows you to store and manage dynamic data that can change over time. State determines how a component renders and behaves.

### When do you use State?

Use state when your component needs to track information that can change, such as user input, toggles, fetched data, or UI visibility. State is essential for interactive and dynamic UIs.

### How do you use State?

- **In Functional Components:** Use the `useState` hook.
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
            <div>
                <p>Count: {count}</p>
                <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```
    - `count` is the state variable.
    - `setCount` updates the state.

- **In Class Components:** Use `this.state` and `this.setState`.
    ```jsx
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    class Counter extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = { count: 0 };
        }

        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
                    <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
                        Increment
                    </button>
                </div>
            );
        }
    }
    ```

### Why is State Important?

- **Interactivity:** Enables components to respond to user actions and input.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Allows UI to update automatically when data changes.
- **Encapsulation:** Each component manages its own state, leading to modular and maintainable code.

**Summary:**  
State in React is used to store and manage changing data within a component, making it possible to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.



## 25. What are props in React? What, when, how, why?

### What are Props in React?

**Props** (short for "properties") are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component in React. They allow data and event handlers to flow down the component tree, enabling components to be dynamic and reusable.

### When do you use Props?

Use props whenever you want to pass data, configuration, or callback functions from a parent to a child component. Props are essential for customizing components and enabling communication between them.

### How do you use Props?

- **Passing Props:** Add attributes to a component when using it.
    ```jsx
    <Greeting name="Alice" />
    ```
- **Receiving Props:** Access props as function arguments in functional components, or via `this.props` in class components.
    ```jsx
    function Greeting(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
    }
    ```
    Or using destructuring:
    ```jsx
    function Greeting({ name }) {
        return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
    }
    ```

### Why are Props Important?

- **Reusability:** Make components configurable and reusable with different data.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Enforce a clear, predictable flow of data from parent to child.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Allow components to focus on rendering UI based on input, without managing the data source.

### Key Points

- Props are immutable inside the receiving component.
- Props can be any JavaScript value: strings, numbers, objects, arrays, or functions.
- Props enable composition and modularity in React applications.

**Summary:**  
Props are the mechanism for passing data and behavior into React components, making them flexible, reusable, and easy to compose.



## 26. What are the differences between state and props?

### State vs Props in React

| Aspect         | State                                              | Props                                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Definition     | Internal data managed by the component itself      | Data passed from parent to child component    |
| Mutability     | Mutable (can be changed with `setState`/`useState`)| Immutable (read-only in the receiving component) |
| Ownership      | Owned and controlled by the component              | Owned by parent, received by child            |
| Usage          | For dynamic data that changes over time            | For configuring child components and passing data/functions |
| Update         | Updated by the component itself                    | Set by parent, cannot be changed by child     |
| Lifecycle      | Exists as long as the component exists             | Passed each time the parent renders           |

### Example

```jsx
function Parent() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // state

    return <Child value={count} />; // passing count as prop
}

function Child({ value }) {
    return <p>Value from parent: {value}</p>; // using prop
}
```

- `count` is state in `Parent`.
- `value` is a prop in `Child`.

**Summary:**  
- **State** is local, mutable, and managed within a component.
- **Props** are external, immutable, and passed from parent to child.
- Use state for internal data and props for communication between components.



## 27. What is a higher-order component in React?

### What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?

A **higher-order component (HOC)** is an advanced React pattern where a function takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced or extended behavior. HOCs are used to reuse component logic across multiple components.

### How does an HOC work?

An HOC is a pure function with the signature:

```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```

It does not modify the original component but returns a new one that wraps the original, adding extra props, logic, or functionality.

### Example: Logging Props with an HOC

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// HOC that logs props
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
    return function LoggedComponent(props) {
        console.log('Props:', props);
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
    };
}

// Usage
function Hello({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

const HelloWithLogger = withLogger(Hello);

// <HelloWithLogger name="Alice" /> will log props and render Hello
```

### Common Use Cases

- Code reuse and logic abstraction (e.g., authentication, data fetching)
- Conditional rendering
- Injecting props or context

### Key Points

- HOCs do not modify the original component; they compose new components.
- HOCs should pass all props to the wrapped component.
- The pattern is similar to higher-order functions in JavaScript.

**Summary:**  
A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced behavior, enabling logic reuse and abstraction in React applications.



## 28. How can you embed two or more components into one?

### How do you compose multiple components in React?

In React, you can embed (compose) two or more components into a single parent component by including them as JSX elements within the parent's render output. This is a core concept in React, enabling you to build complex UIs from smaller, reusable pieces.

### Example

```jsx
function Header() {
    return <header><h1>My App</h1></header>;
}

function Footer() {
    return <footer><p>© 2024 My App</p></footer>;
}

function MainContent() {
    return <main><p>Welcome to the main content!</p></main>;
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            <MainContent />
            <Footer />
        </div>
    );
}
```

In this example:
- `App` embeds `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer` components.
- Each child component is rendered as part of the parent’s JSX structure.

### Why compose components?

- **Reusability:** Break UI into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each component handles its own logic and presentation.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update or replace individual parts of the UI.

**Summary:**  
You can embed multiple components into one by including them as JSX elements within a parent component’s render output, enabling modular and maintainable React applications.



## 29. What are the differences between class and functional components?

### Class Components

- **Syntax:** Defined using ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`.
- **State Management:** Use `this.state` and `this.setState` for managing local state.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Have access to lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
- **`this` Keyword:** Require binding of `this` for event handlers and accessing props/state.
- **Hooks:** Cannot use React Hooks.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
                <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
                    Increment
                </button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

---

### Functional Components

- **Syntax:** Defined as plain JavaScript functions.
- **State Management:** Use React Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) for state and side effects.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** No traditional lifecycle methods; use hooks instead.
- **`this` Keyword:** Do not use `this`; props and state are accessed directly.
- **Hooks:** Can use all React Hooks.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Increment
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

---

### Comparison Table

| Aspect              | Class Component                | Functional Component         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Syntax              | ES6 class                     | JavaScript function         |
| State               | `this.state`, `this.setState` | `useState` hook             |
| Lifecycle           | Lifecycle methods             | Hooks (`useEffect`, etc.)   |
| `this` Binding      | Required                      | Not required                |
| Hooks Support       | No                            | Yes                         |
| Boilerplate         | More                          | Less                        |
| Preferred Usage     | Legacy code                   | Modern React development    |

**Summary:**  
Functional components are simpler, use hooks for state and effects, and are preferred in modern React. Class components are still supported but are less common in new code.



## 30. Explain the lifecycle methods of components.

### What are Lifecycle Methods?

Lifecycle methods are special functions in React class components that are called at specific points in a component's existence: when it mounts (is created), updates (receives new props or state), and unmounts (is removed from the DOM). They allow you to run code at these key moments, such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or cleaning up resources.

### Main Lifecycle Methods in Class Components

1. **Mounting (Component Creation)**
    - `constructor(props)`: Initializes state and binds methods.
    - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`: Syncs state with props before rendering.
    - `render()`: Returns the JSX to render.
    - `componentDidMount()`: Runs after the component is added to the DOM. Good for data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM interactions.

2. **Updating (Props or State Change)**
    - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`: Called before every render, both on mount and update.
    - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`: Determines if the component should re-render.
    - `render()`: Renders the component.
    - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`: Captures information (like scroll position) before the DOM is updated.
    - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`: Runs after the component updates in the DOM. Useful for side effects based on prop/state changes.

3. **Unmounting (Component Removal)**
    - `componentWillUnmount()`: Runs before the component is removed from the DOM. Use for cleanup (e.g., removing event listeners, cancelling timers).

4. **Error Handling**
    - `componentDidCatch(error, info)`: Catches errors in child components and handles them gracefully.

### Example

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Example extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        // Runs after the component is mounted
        console.log('Component mounted');
    }

    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
        // Runs after updates
        if (prevState.count !== this.state.count) {
            console.log('Count updated:', this.state.count);
        }
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
        // Runs before the component is removed
        console.log('Component will unmount');
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
                Count: {this.state.count}
            </button>
        );
    }
}
```

### Lifecycle in Functional Components

Functional components use hooks like `useEffect` to handle lifecycle events:
- `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])` for mount/unmount (like `componentDidMount`/`componentWillUnmount`)
- `useEffect(() => { ... }, [deps])` for updates (like `componentDidUpdate`)

### Summary

Lifecycle methods in class components let you run code at key moments: mounting, updating, unmounting, and error handling. In modern React, hooks provide similar capabilities for functional components.



## 31. What is lifting state up in React?

### What is Lifting State Up?

**Lifting state up** is a React pattern where you move shared state from child components to their closest common ancestor (parent component). This allows multiple components to access and update the same state, ensuring data consistency and enabling communication between siblings.

### Why lift state up?

- To share data or synchronize behavior between sibling components.
- To avoid duplicating state and prevent inconsistencies.
- To centralize state management for related components.

### How do you lift state up?

1. Identify the state that needs to be shared between components.
2. Move the state and its updater function to the nearest common parent.
3. Pass the state and updater as props to the child components.

### Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TemperatureInput({ temperature, onTemperatureChange, label }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <label>
                {label}
                <input
                    type="number"
                    value={temperature}
                    onChange={e => onTemperatureChange(e.target.value)}
                />
            </label>
        </div>
    );
}

function Calculator() {
    const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState('');

    return (
        <div>
            <TemperatureInput
                label="Celsius: "
                temperature={temperature}
                onTemperatureChange={setTemperature}
            />
            <TemperatureInput
                label="Fahrenheit: "
                temperature={temperature !== '' ? (temperature * 9/5 + 32) : ''}
                onTemperatureChange={value => setTemperature(((value - 32) * 5/9))}
            />
        </div>
    );
}
```

In this example:
- The `Calculator` component holds the shared `temperature` state.
- Both `TemperatureInput` components receive the state and updater as props.
- Changing the value in one input updates the other, keeping them in sync.

### Summary

Lifting state up means moving shared state to a common parent so multiple child components can access and update it. This pattern is essential for synchronizing data and enabling communication between related components in React.



## 32. How do we avoid binding in React JS?

### Why is binding needed in React?

In class components, event handler methods do not automatically bind to the component instance (`this`). Without binding, `this` inside the handler may be `undefined`, leading to errors.

### Ways to Avoid Binding

1. **Use Arrow Functions as Class Properties**

Arrow functions automatically bind `this` to the class instance.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    handleClick = () => {
        // 'this' refers to the component instance
        console.log(this);
    };

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
    }
}
```

2. **Bind in the Constructor**

Bind methods once in the constructor to avoid rebinding on every render.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }

    handleClick() {
        console.log(this);
    }

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
    }
}
```

3. **Use Functional Components and Hooks**

Functional components with hooks do not require binding, as there is no `this`.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
    const handleClick = () => {
        // No 'this' binding needed
        console.log('Clicked');
    };

    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

### Summary

- Use arrow functions or bind in the constructor for class components.
- Prefer functional components and hooks to avoid binding altogether.
- These approaches prevent common bugs and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.



## 33. Explain React Fragments.

### What are React Fragments?

React Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are useful when a component needs to return multiple sibling elements, but you don't want to wrap them in an unnecessary `<div>` or other container.

### Why use Fragments?

- **Avoid extra DOM nodes:** Prevents unwanted wrappers that can affect styling, layout, or accessibility.
- **Cleaner markup:** Keeps the rendered HTML structure minimal and semantically correct.

### How to use Fragments?

You can use the `<React.Fragment>` component or its shorthand `<>...</>`.

#### Example with `<React.Fragment>`:

```jsx
function TableRow() {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Age</td>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}
```

#### Example with shorthand syntax:

```jsx
function TableRow() {
    return (
        <>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Age</td>
        </>
    );
}
```

### Key Points

- Fragments can take a `key` prop when mapping lists.
- Shorthand `<>...</>` cannot accept props.

**Summary:**  
React Fragments allow you to return multiple elements from a component without adding extra nodes to the DOM, keeping your markup clean and efficient.



## 34. What is the strict mode in React?

### What is Strict Mode?

**Strict Mode** is a tool in React that helps identify potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants, making it easier to spot unsafe lifecycle methods, legacy API usage, and other issues during development.

### How to Enable Strict Mode

Wrap part or all of your component tree with `<React.StrictMode>`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### What Does Strict Mode Do?

- Warns about deprecated lifecycle methods.
- Detects unexpected side effects.
- Checks for usage of legacy string refs.
- Identifies unsafe context API usage.
- Double-invokes certain functions (like component render and effects) in development to help reveal side effects.

**Note:** Strict Mode does not affect the production build—it's only active in development.

### Why Use Strict Mode?

- Helps catch bugs early.
- Encourages best practices.
- Prepares your codebase for future React features.

**Summary:**  
React Strict Mode is a development-only feature that highlights potential problems in your app, making it easier to write safe and future-proof React code.



## 35. What are the components of the React Router? How does routing work? (With Example)

### What is React Router?

React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different components (pages) without reloading the page, creating a single-page application (SPA) experience.

### Main Components of React Router

1. **`BrowserRouter`**  
    - The top-level component that uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
2. **`Routes`**  
    - A container for all your route definitions.
3. **`Route`**  
    - Defines a mapping between a URL path and a React component.
4. **`Link`**  
    - Used to create navigation links that update the URL without reloading the page.
5. **`Navigate`**  
    - Programmatically redirects to another route.
6. **`Outlet`**  
    - Renders child routes in nested routing scenarios.
7. **`useParams`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`**  
    - Hooks for accessing route parameters, navigation, and location info.

### How Routing Works

- Wrap your app with `BrowserRouter`.
- Define routes using `Routes` and `Route`.
- Use `Link` to navigate between routes.
- When the URL changes, React Router matches the path and renders the corresponding component.

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
     return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
}

function About() {
     return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

function App() {
     return (
          <BrowserRouter>
                <nav>
                     <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
                </nav>
                <Routes>
                     <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                     <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
                </Routes>
          </BrowserRouter>
     );
}

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**
- `BrowserRouter` wraps the app to enable routing.
- `Routes` contains all route definitions.
- `Route` maps URL paths to components.
- `Link` allows navigation without page reloads.

**Summary:**  
React Router uses components like `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, and `Link` to manage navigation in React apps, enabling seamless client-side routing and SPA behavior.



## 36. What is Redux and how does it relate to React? Explain all the steps required to add redux functionality to an app with a simple example.

### What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a single, centralized store for all application state, making state changes explicit and traceable. Redux is framework-agnostic but is commonly used with React for managing complex or shared state.

### How does Redux relate to React?

- **Separation of Concerns:** Redux manages state and logic, while React handles UI rendering.
- **Integration:** The `react-redux` library connects Redux to React, allowing components to access and update the Redux store via hooks or higher-order components.
- **Predictability:** Redux enforces unidirectional data flow, making state changes easier to debug and reason about in React apps.

### Steps to Add Redux Functionality to a React App

#### 1. Install Redux and React-Redux

```bash
npm install redux react-redux
```

#### 2. Create a Redux Store

```js
// store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

// Reducer function
function counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

// Create the store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

export default store;
```

#### 3. Provide the Store to React

Wrap your app with the `Provider` component from `react-redux`:

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>
);
```

#### 4. Connect Components to Redux

Use the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks from `react-redux` to read state and dispatch actions.

```jsx
// Counter.js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

function Counter() {
    const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

#### 5. Use the Connected Component

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Redux Counter Example</h1>
            <Counter />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### Summary

- Redux provides a single store for state management.
- Use `react-redux` to connect Redux with React components.
- Steps: install dependencies, create a store and reducer, wrap your app with `Provider`, and use hooks to access and update state.
- Redux is especially useful for managing shared or complex state in React applications.


## 37. What are the components of Redux?

Redux is built around a few core components that work together to manage application state in a predictable way:

### 1. **Store**
- The single source of truth for the application's state.
- Holds the entire state tree as a plain JavaScript object.
- Created using `createStore` (or `configureStore` in Redux Toolkit).

### 2. **Actions**
- Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened.
- Must have a `type` property (string), and can include additional data (payload).
- Example: `{ type: 'INCREMENT' }`

### 3. **Reducers**
- Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.
- Specify how the state changes in response to actions.
- Example:
    ```js
    function counter(state = 0, action) {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'INCREMENT':
                return state + 1;
            case 'DECREMENT':
                return state - 1;
            default:
                return state;
        }
    }
    ```

### 4. **Dispatch**
- A method on the store used to send actions to the reducer.
- Triggers the state update process.
- Example: `store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })`

### 5. **Selectors**
- Functions that extract specific pieces of state from the store.
- Help keep components decoupled from the state structure.

### 6. **Middleware** (optional)
- Functions that intercept actions before they reach the reducer.
- Used for logging, async operations, etc. (e.g., `redux-thunk`, `redux-saga`).

### 7. **Provider** (React-Redux)
- A React component that makes the Redux store available to the component tree via context.

**Summary:**  
The main components of Redux are the store, actions, reducers, dispatch, selectors, middleware, and (in React) the Provider. Together, they enable predictable and centralized state management.

## 38. What is Flux? How is Redux different from Flux?

### What is the Flux architecture pattern?

Flux is an application architecture developed by Facebook for building client-side web applications with unidirectional data flow. It was designed to address the complexity of managing state and data flow in large React applications. Flux enforces a strict data flow pattern, making state changes predictable and easier to debug.

### Key Concepts of Flux

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data flows in a single direction, reducing complexity and making state changes traceable.
- **Dispatcher:** A central hub that manages all data flow in the application. It receives actions and dispatches them to stores.
- **Stores:** Containers for application state and logic. Stores listen for actions dispatched by the dispatcher and update their state accordingly.
- **Actions:** Plain objects or functions that describe events or user interactions. Actions are sent to the dispatcher.
- **Views (React Components):** UI components that listen to stores for state changes and re-render accordingly.

### Relationship with React

Flux complements React by providing a structured way to manage state outside of components. React handles the UI, while Flux manages how data changes and flows through the app. This separation improves maintainability and scalability.

### Step-by-Step: Implementing Flux in a React App

#### 1. Define Actions

Actions are payloads of information that send data from the application to the dispatcher.

```js
// actions.js
export const increment = () => ({
    type: 'INCREMENT'
});

export const decrement = () => ({
    type: 'DECREMENT'
});
```

#### 2. Create a Dispatcher

The dispatcher is a central hub that dispatches actions to stores.

```js
// dispatcher.js
import { Dispatcher } from 'flux';
const appDispatcher = new Dispatcher();
export default appDispatcher;
```

#### 3. Create a Store

Stores hold the application state and logic. They register with the dispatcher to receive actions.

```js
// counterStore.js
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';
import appDispatcher from './dispatcher';

let count = 0;

class CounterStore extends EventEmitter {
    getCount() {
        return count;
    }

    handleActions(action) {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'INCREMENT':
                count += 1;
                this.emit('change');
                break;
            case 'DECREMENT':
                count -= 1;
                this.emit('change');
                break;
            default:
        }
    }
}

const counterStore = new CounterStore();
appDispatcher.register(counterStore.handleActions.bind(counterStore));
export default counterStore;
```

#### 4. Connect Store to React Components

React components listen for store changes and update their state accordingly.

```jsx
// Counter.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import counterStore from './counterStore';
import appDispatcher from './dispatcher';
import { increment, decrement } from './actions';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(counterStore.getCount());

    useEffect(() => {
        const onChange = () => setCount(counterStore.getCount());
        counterStore.on('change', onChange);
        return () => counterStore.removeListener('change', onChange);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => appDispatcher.dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={() => appDispatcher.dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

#### 5. Use the Component

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Flux Counter Example</h1>
            <Counter />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### How is Redux different from Flux?

Redux is inspired by Flux but simplifies the architecture:
- Redux uses a single store instead of multiple stores.
- Redux eliminates the dispatcher; actions are sent directly to the store.
- State in Redux is immutable and updated via pure reducer functions.

**Summary:**  
Flux is an architecture for managing unidirectional data flow in React apps, using actions, a dispatcher, stores, and views. Redux is a popular implementation inspired by Flux, with a simplified and more predictable approach.


## 39. What is the difference between Context API and Redux?

### Context API

- **Purpose:** Built-in React feature for sharing data (like theme, user info) across the component tree without prop drilling.
- **Usage:** Best for simple or moderate global state (e.g., theme, locale, authenticated user).
- **API:** Uses `createContext`, `Provider`, and `useContext` hook.
- **Boilerplate:** Minimal setup, no external dependencies.
- **Performance:** Frequent updates to large context values can cause unnecessary re-renders of all consuming components.
- **DevTools:** Basic support via React DevTools.

### Redux

- **Purpose:** External library for predictable, centralized state management, especially in large or complex apps.
- **Usage:** Ideal for complex state logic, shared state across many components, or when you need advanced features (middleware, time-travel debugging).
- **API:** Uses a single store, actions, reducers, and dispatch; integrates with React via `react-redux`.
- **Boilerplate:** More setup and code structure, but Redux Toolkit reduces boilerplate.
- **Performance:** Fine-grained control over state updates; selectors and memoization help optimize re-renders.
- **DevTools:** Powerful Redux DevTools for debugging, time-travel, and state inspection.

### Comparison Table

| Feature           | Context API                | Redux                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Type              | React built-in            | External library               |
| Setup             | Minimal                   | More involved                  |
| State Location    | Multiple contexts allowed | Single global store            |
| Boilerplate       | Low                       | Higher (less with Toolkit)     |
| Middleware        | No                        | Yes (e.g., redux-thunk, saga)  |
| DevTools          | Basic                     | Advanced                       |
| Use Case          | Simple/moderate global    | Complex, shared, or large state|

**Summary:**  
Use Context API for simple global state and avoiding prop drilling. Use Redux for complex, large-scale state management with advanced debugging and middleware needs.



## 40. How do you style React components? Explain with example.

There are several ways to style React components, each with its own use cases and benefits:

### 1. Inline Styles

You can use the `style` prop to apply styles directly to elements as a JavaScript object.

```jsx
function InlineStyledButton() {
    return (
        <button style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white', padding: '10px' }}>
            Inline Styled Button
        </button>
    );
}
```

### 2. CSS Stylesheets

Import a regular CSS file and use class names.

```css
/* Button.css */
.button {
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

```jsx
import './Button.css';

function CssStyledButton() {
    return <button className="button">CSS Styled Button</button>;
}
```

### 3. CSS Modules

CSS Modules scope styles locally to the component.

```css
/* Button.module.css */
.button {
    background-color: orange;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

```jsx
import styles from './Button.module.css';

function ModuleStyledButton() {
    return <button className={styles.button}>Module Styled Button</button>;
}
```

### 4. Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)

Use libraries like `styled-components` for dynamic and scoped styles.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledButton = styled.button`
    background-color: purple;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
`;

function StyledComponentsButton() {
    return <StyledButton>Styled Components Button</StyledButton>;
}
```

### 5. Utility-First CSS Frameworks

Use frameworks like Tailwind CSS for utility classes.

```jsx
function TailwindButton() {
    return (
        <button className="bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2">
            Tailwind Styled Button
        </button>
    );
}
```

---

**Summary:**  
You can style React components using inline styles, CSS files, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS libraries, or utility-first frameworks. Choose the approach that best fits your project's needs and complexity.



## 41. Explain the use of CSS Modules in React

### What are CSS Modules?

CSS Modules are a styling solution in React that enables you to write CSS that is scoped locally to a specific component, preventing class name collisions and making styles easier to maintain.

### How do CSS Modules work?

When you import a CSS file with the `.module.css` extension, each class name is automatically transformed into a unique identifier. This ensures that styles defined in one component do not affect others, even if they use the same class names.

### How to use CSS Modules in React

1. **Create a CSS Module file:**  
    Name your CSS file with the `.module.css` extension, e.g., `Button.module.css`.

    ```css
    /* Button.module.css */
    .button {
         background-color: teal;
         color: white;
         padding: 10px 20px;
         border: none;
         border-radius: 4px;
    }
    ```

2. **Import the CSS Module in your component:**  
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import styles from './Button.module.css';

    function Button() {
         return <button className={styles.button}>Click Me</button>;
    }

    export default Button;
    ```

    - `styles.button` refers to the locally scoped class name generated by the build tool.

### Benefits of CSS Modules

- **Local Scope:** Styles are scoped to the component, avoiding global namespace pollution.
- **No Naming Conflicts:** Multiple components can use the same class names without conflicts.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and refactor styles in large projects.

### When to use CSS Modules?

- When you want modular, reusable components with encapsulated styles.
- In medium to large React projects where style conflicts are likely.

**Summary:**  
CSS Modules provide a way to write modular, locally scoped CSS in React, making it easier to manage styles and avoid conflicts between components.




## 42. Explain about types of side effects in React component. Effects without Cleanup & Effects with Cleanup

### Types of Side Effects in React

React components often need to perform side effects—operations that interact with the outside world or affect things outside the component’s scope. Side effects can be categorized based on whether they require cleanup.

#### 1. Effects Without Cleanup

These are side effects that do not need any cleanup when the component unmounts or before the effect runs again. Examples include:

- Fetching data from an API
- Logging to the console
- Updating the document title

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function DocumentTitle({ count }) {
    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
    }, [count]); // No cleanup needed
    return <button>{count}</button>;
}
```

#### 2. Effects With Cleanup

Some side effects require cleanup to avoid memory leaks or unwanted behavior. Cleanup is needed when:

- Subscribing to external data sources (e.g., WebSocket, event listeners)
- Setting up timers or intervals

You return a cleanup function from `useEffect`, which React calls before the component unmounts or before re-running the effect.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Timer() {
    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => setSeconds(s => s + 1), 1000);
        return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup on unmount
    }, []);

    return <p>Seconds: {seconds}</p>;
}
```

### Summary

- **Effects without cleanup:** No resource allocation; just perform the effect.
- **Effects with cleanup:** Allocate resources (subscriptions, timers) and clean them up to prevent leaks.
- Use the return value of `useEffect` for cleanup logic.


## 43. How to perform automatic redirect after login?

To automatically redirect a user after a successful login in React, you typically use a routing library like React Router. After verifying login credentials, you can programmatically navigate to another route using the `useNavigate` hook (React Router v6+) or `useHistory` (React Router v5).

### Example with React Router v6

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function Login() {
    const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
    const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
    const navigate = useNavigate();

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        // Replace with real authentication logic
        if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
            // Redirect to dashboard after successful login
            navigate('/dashboard');
        } else {
            alert('Invalid credentials');
        }
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={username}
                onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)}
                placeholder="Username"
            />
            <input
                type="password"
                value={password}
                onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)}
                placeholder="Password"
            />
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form>
    );
}

export default Login;
```

**Key Points:**
- Use `useNavigate()` to get the navigation function.
- Call `navigate('/target-path')` after successful login to redirect.
- For React Router v5, use `useHistory()` and `history.push('/target-path')`.

**Summary:**  
After login, use React Router's navigation hooks to programmatically redirect users to the desired page.


## 44. How to pass data between sibling components using React Router?

Passing data directly between sibling components using React Router is not supported out-of-the-box, as React Router is primarily for navigation and route management. However, you can achieve data sharing between siblings in a few common ways:

### 1. Lift State Up to a Common Parent

Move the shared state to the nearest common ancestor of the sibling components, and pass the data as props.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Parent() {
    const [sharedData, setSharedData] = useState('Hello from Parent');

    return (
        <div>
            <nav>
                <Link to="/sibling1">Sibling 1</Link>
                <Link to="/sibling2">Sibling 2</Link>
            </nav>
            <Routes>
                <Route path="/sibling1" element={<Sibling1 data={sharedData} setData={setSharedData} />} />
                <Route path="/sibling2" element={<Sibling2 data={sharedData} setData={setSharedData} />} />
            </Routes>
        </div>
    );
}

function Sibling1({ data, setData }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Sibling 1</h2>
            <p>Data: {data}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setData('Updated by Sibling 1')}>Update Data</button>
        </div>
    );
}

function Sibling2({ data, setData }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Sibling 2</h2>
            <p>Data: {data}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setData('Updated by Sibling 2')}>Update Data</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```
- Both siblings receive and update the shared data via props from the parent.

### 2. Use Context API

If the siblings are deeply nested or you want to avoid prop drilling, use React Context to provide and consume shared data.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const DataContext = createContext();

function Parent() {
    const [data, setData] = useState('Shared via Context');
    return (
        <DataContext.Provider value={{ data, setData }}>
            {/* ...Routes and Links... */}
        </DataContext.Provider>
    );
}

function Sibling1() {
    const { data, setData } = useContext(DataContext);
    // ...
}

function Sibling2() {
    const { data, setData } = useContext(DataContext);
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Pass Data via Navigation (Not Recommended for Large Data)

For small pieces of data, you can use React Router's `navigate` function with the `state` option:

```jsx
// In Sibling1
navigate('/sibling2', { state: { message: 'Hello from Sibling1' } });

// In Sibling2
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
const location = useLocation();
console.log(location.state?.message);
```
- This is suitable for transient or small data, not for persistent shared state.

**Summary:**  
To pass data between sibling components with React Router, lift state up to a common parent or use React Context for shared state. For small, one-off data, you can use navigation state, but it's not ideal for ongoing synchronization.


## 45. How to re-render the view when the browser is resized?

To re-render a React component when the browser window is resized, you can listen for the `resize` event and update component state accordingly. Changing state triggers a re-render.

### Example using `useEffect` and `useState`

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function WindowSize() {
    const [size, setSize] = useState({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
    });

    useEffect(() => {
        const handleResize = () => {
            setSize({
                width: window.innerWidth,
                height: window.innerHeight,
            });
        };

        window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
        return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Width: {size.width}px</p>
            <p>Height: {size.height}px</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default WindowSize;
```

**Key Points:**
- Use `useEffect` to add and clean up the resize event listener.
- Update state in the event handler to trigger a re-render.
- The component will update whenever the window size changes.

**Summary:**  
Listen for the `resize` event, update state in the handler, and React will re-render the component when the browser is resized.

## 46. How to create a switching component for displaying different pages?

To create a component that switches between different pages or views in React, you can use state to track the current page and render the appropriate component based on that state. For more complex routing, React Router is recommended, but for simple cases, manual switching works well.

### Example: Manual Page Switching

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Home() {
    return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
}

function About() {
    return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

function Contact() {
    return <h2>Contact Page</h2>;
}

function PageSwitcher() {
    const [page, setPage] = useState('home');

    let content;
    switch (page) {
        case 'about':
            content = <About />;
            break;
        case 'contact':
            content = <Contact />;
            break;
        default:
            content = <Home />;
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <nav>
                <button onClick={() => setPage('home')}>Home</button>
                <button onClick={() => setPage('about')}>About</button>
                <button onClick={() => setPage('contact')}>Contact</button>
            </nav>
            <div>{content}</div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default PageSwitcher;
```

**How it works:**
- The `PageSwitcher` component uses state to track the current page.
- Navigation buttons update the state.
- The component renders the corresponding page component based on the current state.

**Summary:**  
Use state and conditional rendering to switch between different pages in a React component. For larger apps, consider using React Router for more robust routing.


## 47. Explain conditional rendering in React.

### What is Conditional Rendering?

Conditional rendering in React means displaying different UI elements or components based on certain conditions, such as state, props, or other logic. It allows you to dynamically control what appears on the screen.

### How to Implement Conditional Rendering

There are several common ways to implement conditional rendering in React:

#### 1. Using `if` Statements

You can use standard JavaScript `if` statements to decide what to render.

```jsx
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
    if (isLoggedIn) {
        return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
    }
    return <h1>Please sign in.</h1>;
}
```

#### 2. Using the Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is often used directly in JSX for concise conditional rendering.

```jsx
function UserStatus({ online }) {
    return (
        <div>
            {online ? <span>Online</span> : <span>Offline</span>}
        </div>
    );
}
```

#### 3. Using Logical `&&` Operator

Render a component or element only if a condition is true.

```jsx
function Notification({ message }) {
    return (
        <div>
            {message && <p>{message}</p>}
        </div>
    );
}
```

#### 4. Conditional Rendering with Switch Statements

For multiple conditions, use a switch statement or a mapping object.

```jsx
function Page({ page }) {
    switch (page) {
        case 'home':
            return <Home />;
        case 'about':
            return <About />;
        default:
            return <NotFound />;
    }
}
```

### Why Use Conditional Rendering?

- To show or hide elements based on user actions or application state.
- To display different layouts or components for different scenarios.
- To improve user experience by providing relevant feedback or content.

**Summary:**  
Conditional rendering in React lets you display different UI based on conditions, using JavaScript logic like `if`, ternary, or logical operators directly in your components.

## 48. Do Hooks cover all the functionalities provided by the classes?

React Hooks were introduced to bring state and lifecycle features to functional components, making them as powerful as class components for most use cases. Hooks cover almost all functionalities that class components provide, including:

- **State management** (`useState`, `useReducer`)
- **Lifecycle methods** (`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`)
- **Refs and imperative methods** (`useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`)
- **Context** (`useContext`)
- **Error boundaries** (not yet supported in functional components; still require class components)

### Are there any limitations?

The main limitation is that **error boundaries** can only be implemented using class components. Functional components cannot catch rendering errors using hooks as of now. For all other features, Hooks provide equivalent or improved functionality compared to classes.

**Summary:**  
Hooks cover nearly all class component features except error boundaries. For error handling at the component level, you still need class components, but for everything else, Hooks are sufficient and recommended for new React code.

## 49. How does the performance of using Hooks differ in comparison with classes?

### Performance Comparison: Hooks vs Class Components

In most cases, **React Hooks and class components have similar performance**. Both are abstractions over the same underlying React reconciliation and rendering engine. However, there are some practical considerations:

- **Initial Render:** There is no significant difference in initial render performance between Hooks and classes.
- **Re-renders:** Hooks can sometimes lead to more frequent re-renders if dependencies in hooks like `useEffect` or `useCallback` are not managed carefully. However, this is usually a matter of developer implementation rather than an inherent performance issue.
- **Memory Usage:** Hooks may use slightly less memory because they avoid the overhead of class instances and method bindings, but the difference is negligible for most apps.
- **Boilerplate Reduction:** Hooks reduce boilerplate, making it easier to write optimized code (e.g., using `useMemo`, `useCallback` for memoization).
- **Concurrent Features:** Hooks are designed to work seamlessly with React's concurrent features and future optimizations.

### Key Points

- **No major performance difference** between Hooks and classes for most use cases.
- Hooks can make it easier to optimize components due to their composability and simpler code structure.
- Performance issues are more likely to arise from improper use of hooks (e.g., unnecessary effects or missing dependencies) rather than from Hooks themselves.

**Summary:**  
Hooks and class components perform similarly in React. Hooks may offer slight advantages in code clarity and optimization opportunities, but overall performance depends on how components are implemented and optimized.

## 50. How to pass data between React components? Explain all possible ways.

Passing data between React components is essential for building interactive applications. The method you choose depends on the relationship between the components (parent-child, siblings, or unrelated). Here are the main ways to pass data:

### 1. **Props (Parent to Child)**

The most common way to pass data is via props from a parent to its child component.

```jsx
function Parent() {
    const message = "Hello from Parent";
    return <Child data={message} />;
}

function Child({ data }) {
    return <p>{data}</p>;
}
```

---

### 2. **Callback Functions (Child to Parent)**

To send data from a child to its parent, pass a callback function as a prop.

```jsx
function Parent() {
    const handleData = (value) => {
        console.log("Received from child:", value);
    };
    return <Child onSend={handleData} />;
}

function Child({ onSend }) {
    return <button onClick={() => onSend("Hello Parent!")}>Send</button>;
}
```

---

### 3. **Lifting State Up (Between Siblings)**

For sibling components, lift the shared state up to their nearest common ancestor and pass data via props.

```jsx
function Parent() {
    const [shared, setShared] = React.useState("Initial");
    return (
        <>
            <Sibling1 value={shared} setValue={setShared} />
            <Sibling2 value={shared} setValue={setShared} />
        </>
    );
}
```

---

### 4. **React Context API (Any Level in Tree)**

Use Context to share data globally or across deeply nested components without prop drilling.

```jsx
const MyContext = React.createContext();

function Parent() {
    const value = "Shared via Context";
    return (
        <MyContext.Provider value={value}>
            <Child />
        </MyContext.Provider>
    );
}

function Child() {
    const value = React.useContext(MyContext);
    return <p>{value}</p>;
}
```

---

### 5. **State Management Libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc.)**

For large or complex apps, use a state management library to share data across any component.

```jsx
// Example with Redux
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

function ComponentA() {
    const value = useSelector(state => state.value);
    return <p>{value}</p>;
}

function ComponentB() {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    return <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'SET', payload: 'New Value' })}>Update</button>;
}
```

---

### 6. **Refs (Imperative Data Sharing)**

Refs can be used to share data or methods imperatively between components, usually with `forwardRef` or when integrating with third-party libraries.

---

### 7. **URL Params or Query Strings**

For unrelated components rendered by different routes, pass data via URL parameters or query strings and read them using React Router hooks.

---

**Summary:**  
- Use **props** for parent-to-child.
- Use **callbacks** for child-to-parent.
- **Lift state up** for siblings.
- Use **Context** or **state management libraries** for global or cross-tree sharing.
- Use **refs** or **URL params** for special cases.

Choose the method that best fits your component relationships and app complexity.

## 51. How to prevent re-renders in React?

Preventing unnecessary re-renders in React is important for optimizing performance, especially in large applications. Here are common strategies:

### 1. Use `React.memo` for Functional Components

`React.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes the result of a functional component. It prevents re-rendering if the props have not changed.

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
    // ...component code
});
```

### 2. Use `PureComponent` for Class Components

`React.PureComponent` automatically implements a shallow prop and state comparison in `shouldComponentUpdate`, preventing re-renders if there are no changes.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
    // ...component code
}
```

### 3. Implement `shouldComponentUpdate` Manually

For class components, override `shouldComponentUpdate` to control when a component should re-render.

```jsx
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    return nextProps.value !== this.props.value;
}
```

### 4. Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` Hooks

- `useMemo` memoizes expensive calculations.
- `useCallback` memoizes functions so they are not recreated on every render.

```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => doSomething(a), [a]);
```

### 5. Avoid Inline Functions and Objects in JSX

Inline functions and objects create new references on every render, causing child components to re-render. Move them outside the render or memoize with `useCallback`/`useMemo`.

### 6. Optimize Context Usage

Frequent updates to context values can cause all consuming components to re-render. Split context or minimize updates to avoid this.

### Summary

- Use `React.memo`, `PureComponent`, or `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Memoize values and callbacks with `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
- Avoid creating new objects/functions in JSX.
- Optimize context usage to limit re-renders.

These techniques help keep your React app performant by minimizing unnecessary rendering.


## 52. What is React Fiber?

### What is React Fiber?

React Fiber is the underlying reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. It is a complete rewrite of React's core algorithm, designed to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM. Fiber allows React to break rendering work into small units and spread it out over multiple frames, improving responsiveness and enabling features like concurrency.

### Why was Fiber introduced?

The original React reconciliation algorithm was synchronous and could block the main thread during large updates, leading to performance issues in complex applications. Fiber was introduced to:

- Enable interruptible rendering, so React can pause, resume, or abort work as needed.
- Prioritize updates, allowing more important updates (like user input) to be processed first.
- Lay the foundation for advanced features like Suspense, concurrent rendering, and time slicing.

### How does Fiber work?

- **Work Units:** Fiber breaks rendering into small units of work called "fibers."
- **Scheduling:** React can schedule, pause, and resume these units, yielding control back to the browser to keep the UI responsive.
- **Prioritization:** Updates can be assigned different priorities, so urgent tasks (like responding to user input) are handled before less critical ones.

### Key Benefits

- **Improved Performance:** Large updates no longer block the main thread.
- **Concurrency:** Enables features like concurrent rendering and Suspense.
- **Better User Experience:** Smoother, more responsive interfaces, especially in complex apps.

### Summary

React Fiber is the core algorithm that powers React's rendering and reconciliation. It enables incremental, prioritized, and interruptible rendering, making modern React features and improved performance possible.

## 53. What is the "yield" catchphrase in React?

There is no official "yield catchphrase" in React. However, the term "yield" is sometimes mentioned in the context of React Fiber, the internal reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. In this context, "yield" refers to React's ability to pause (yield) its rendering work to allow the browser to handle higher-priority tasks, such as user input or animations.

### Explanation

- **Yielding in React Fiber:**  
    React Fiber breaks rendering into small units of work. If rendering takes too long, React can "yield" control back to the browser, then resume rendering later. This makes the UI more responsive and prevents blocking the main thread.

- **Not a React API:**  
    "yield" is not a React API or a keyword you use in your components. It's an internal concept related to how React schedules and prioritizes rendering work.

### Summary

The "yield" catchphrase in React refers to Fiber's ability to pause and resume rendering for better responsiveness. It is not a feature or API you use directly in your code, but an internal mechanism that improves user experience in complex applications.

## 54. What are stateless components?

### What is a Stateless Component?

A **stateless component** in React is a component that does not manage or hold its own state. It simply receives data (props) from its parent and renders UI based on those props. Stateless components are also known as **functional components** (prior to the introduction of hooks).

### Characteristics

- No internal state management (`useState` or `this.state`).
- Pure functions: given the same props, they always render the same output.
- Easier to test and reuse.
- Typically used for presentational purposes.

### Example

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

- `Greeting` is a stateless component because it only uses the `name` prop and does not manage any state.

### When to Use

- For simple UI elements that only depend on props.
- When you want to separate presentation from logic.

**Summary:**  
Stateless components are simple, reusable functions that render UI based solely on props, making them ideal for presentational purposes in React.


## 55. Explain Jest with example.

### What is Jest?

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework developed by Meta (Facebook). It is widely used for testing React applications but can be used to test any JavaScript code. Jest provides a simple API for writing unit, integration, and snapshot tests, and includes features like test runners, assertions, mocking, and code coverage out of the box.

### Key Features

- Zero configuration for most projects
- Fast and parallel test execution
- Built-in mocking and spies
- Snapshot testing for React components
- Code coverage reporting

### Example: Testing a React Component with Jest

Suppose you have a simple `Counter` component:

```jsx
// Counter.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

You can write a Jest test for this component using React Testing Library:

```jsx
// Counter.test.js
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Counter from './Counter';

test('increments count when button is clicked', () => {
    render(<Counter />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/Count: 0/i)).toBeInTheDocument();

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/Increment/i));
    expect(screen.getByText(/Count: 1/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### How to Run Jest Tests

1. Install Jest (and React Testing Library for React apps):

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react
    ```

2. Add a test script in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
    }
    ```

3. Run your tests:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

### Summary

Jest is a powerful, easy-to-use testing framework for JavaScript and React applications. It supports unit, integration, and snapshot testing, and works seamlessly with tools like React Testing Library for component testing.


## 56. What is React Testing Library? How is it different from Jest?

### What is React Testing Library?

React Testing Library (RTL) is a lightweight testing library for React components. Its primary goal is to encourage testing components in a way that simulates how users interact with your app, focusing on the rendered output and user events rather than implementation details.

### Key Features

- Tests components from the user's perspective (queries by text, label, role, etc.)
- Encourages best practices by avoiding reliance on component internals
- Works well with Jest as the test runner and assertion library

### Example: Testing a React Component with React Testing Library

Suppose you have a simple `Greeting` component:

```jsx
// Greeting.js
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

You can test it using React Testing Library:

```jsx
// Greeting.test.js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

test('renders greeting with name', () => {
    render(<Greeting name="Alice" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Hello, Alice!')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### How is React Testing Library different from Jest?

- **Jest** is a test runner and assertion library. It runs your tests, provides functions like `test`, `expect`, and handles mocking.
- **React Testing Library** is a utility for rendering React components and querying the DOM in tests. It does not run tests or provide assertions; it works alongside Jest (or another test runner).

**Summary Table:**

| Feature                | Jest                        | React Testing Library           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Test runner & assertions    | Render & query React components |
| Provides               | `test`, `expect`, mocking   | `render`, `screen`, user events |
| Usage                  | Any JS code                 | React components                |
| Relationship           | Can be used alone           | Used with Jest or similar       |

**Summary:**  
React Testing Library is used to render and interact with React components in tests, focusing on user behavior. Jest is the test runner and assertion framework. They are commonly used together for effective React testing.


## 57. What is Babel? How, when, why, and how do you use it?

### What is Babel?

Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler (transpiler) that converts modern JavaScript (ES6/ESNext) and JSX syntax into code that is compatible with older browsers and environments. It enables developers to use the latest language features and React JSX without worrying about browser support.

### Why use Babel?

- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensures your code runs in environments that do not support the latest JavaScript features.
- **JSX Support:** Transforms JSX syntax into standard JavaScript (`React.createElement` calls) so browsers can understand it.
- **Future-Proofing:** Allows you to use upcoming JavaScript features today.
- **Ecosystem Integration:** Works with tools like Webpack, Parcel, and Create React App.

### When do you use Babel?

- When building React applications (to compile JSX).
- When using modern JavaScript features not supported by all target browsers.
- In any project where you want to write future-proof or experimental JavaScript.

### How does Babel work?

1. **Parsing:** Babel parses your source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
2. **Transformation:** Babel plugins transform the AST, converting modern syntax and JSX into compatible code.
3. **Generation:** Babel generates the transformed JavaScript code from the AST.

### How to use Babel?

- **With Build Tools:** Most React projects (Create React App, Vite, Webpack) include Babel by default.
- **Manual Setup:** Install Babel and configure it with a `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` file.

#### Example: Manual Babel Setup

1. Install Babel and presets:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
    ```

2. Create a `.babelrc` file:
    ```json
    {
      "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
    }
    ```

3. Compile your code:
    ```bash
    npx babel src --out-dir dist
    ```

### Summary

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that enables you to use modern JavaScript and JSX in your projects by converting them into code that works in all browsers. It is essential for React development and is typically integrated into modern build tools.


## 58. What is the difference between ReactJS and React Native?

### ReactJS

- **Definition:** ReactJS (or simply React) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications.
- **Platform:** Used for developing web apps that run in browsers.
- **Rendering:** Renders UI components as HTML elements in the browser's DOM.
- **Styling:** Uses CSS or CSS-in-JS for styling components.
- **Navigation:** Uses libraries like React Router for client-side routing.
- **Ecosystem:** Integrates with web-specific tools and libraries.

### React Native

- **Definition:** React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications using React.
- **Platform:** Used for developing mobile apps for iOS and Android.
- **Rendering:** Renders UI components as native widgets (not HTML) using platform-specific APIs.
- **Styling:** Uses a JavaScript-based styling system similar to CSS, but with some differences (e.g., `StyleSheet.create`).
- **Navigation:** Uses libraries like React Navigation for mobile navigation patterns.
- **Ecosystem:** Integrates with native modules and device APIs.

### Key Differences Table

| Aspect         | ReactJS (React)           | React Native                  |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Target         | Web browsers              | Mobile devices (iOS, Android) |
| Rendering      | HTML in DOM               | Native components             |
| Styling        | CSS/CSS-in-JS             | JavaScript stylesheets        |
| Navigation     | React Router              | React Navigation              |
| Platform APIs  | Web APIs                  | Native device APIs            |
| Output         | Web app                   | Native mobile app             |

**Summary:**  
ReactJS is for building web applications, rendering HTML in browsers. React Native is for building native mobile apps, rendering native UI components on iOS and Android, using the same React concepts but targeting different platforms.



## 59. What are pure components?

### What is a Pure Component?

A **pure component** in React is a component that renders the same output for the same props and state. It implements a shallow comparison of props and state to determine whether a re-render is necessary, helping to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders.

### In Class Components

React provides `React.PureComponent`, which is similar to `React.Component` but with a built-in `shouldComponentUpdate` method that performs a shallow comparison of props and state.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
    }
}
```
- `MyComponent` will only re-render if `this.props.value` changes (by shallow comparison).

### In Functional Components

Functional components can achieve similar behavior using `React.memo`, which memoizes the component and only re-renders if props change.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ value }) {
    return <div>{value}</div>;
});
```

### When to Use Pure Components

- When your component renders the same output for the same props and state.
- To optimize performance in components that receive frequently updated props.

### Key Points

- Pure components help avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `React.PureComponent` for class components and `React.memo` for functional components.
- Shallow comparison means only the first level of props and state are compared; nested objects may still cause unnecessary renders if mutated.

**Summary:**  
Pure components optimize rendering by preventing unnecessary updates when props and state have not changed, improving performance in React applications.


## 60. Explain how to memoize a component?

### What is Memoization in React?

Memoization in React refers to optimizing components so they only re-render when their props change. This prevents unnecessary renders and improves performance, especially for components that are expensive to render or receive frequently changing parent props.

### How to Memoize a Functional Component

Use the `React.memo` higher-order component to memoize functional components. `React.memo` performs a shallow comparison of props and skips rendering if the props have not changed.

#### Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ value }) {
    console.log('Rendering ExpensiveComponent');
    return <div>Value: {value}</div>;
});
```

- `ExpensiveComponent` will only re-render if the `value` prop changes.

### Custom Comparison

You can provide a custom comparison function as the second argument to `React.memo` for more control over when the component should update.

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(
    function MyComponent(props) {
        // ...component code
    },
    (prevProps, nextProps) => {
        // return true if props are equal, false otherwise
    }
);
```

### Memoizing Class Components

Class components can be optimized using `React.PureComponent`, which implements a shallow prop and state comparison.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
    }
}
```

### When to Use Memoization

- For components that render large lists or perform expensive calculations.
- When child components receive props that rarely change.
- To prevent unnecessary re-renders caused by parent updates.

**Summary:**  
Memoize functional components with `React.memo` and class components with `React.PureComponent` to optimize rendering and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.


## 61. How to use production mode in React?

### What is Production Mode in React?

Production mode in React enables optimizations such as minification, dead code elimination, and removal of development warnings and extra checks. This results in smaller, faster, and more secure builds for deployment.

### How to Enable Production Mode

Production mode is automatically enabled when you build your React app for production using your build tool (e.g., Create React App, Vite, Webpack).

#### With Create React App

1. Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2. This creates an optimized `build/` folder with production-ready assets.

#### With Vite

1. Run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2. The output is in the `dist/` folder, optimized for production.

#### With Webpack

- Set the `mode` to `"production"` in your `webpack.config.js`:
    ```js
    module.exports = {
        mode: 'production',
        // ...other config
    };
    ```
- Run your build script.

### How Does React Know It's Production?

React checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. When `NODE_ENV` is set to `"production"`, React disables development warnings and enables optimizations.

- Most build tools set `NODE_ENV=production` automatically during the build process.

### Summary

- Use your build tool’s production build command (`npm run build`) to enable production mode.
- Production mode optimizes your React app for performance and removes development-only code.
- Always deploy the production build, not the development build, to your server.


## 62. How will you update props in React?

In React, **props are read-only** and cannot be updated directly by the receiving (child) component. Props are passed from a parent component to a child, and only the parent can change the value of the props it provides.

### How to "update" props

To update a prop value in a child component, you must update the corresponding state or value in the parent component. When the parent re-renders with new prop values, the child receives the updated props.

#### Example

```jsx
function Parent() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <Child count={count} />
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

function Child({ count }) {
    return <p>Count from parent: {count}</p>;
}
```

- The `Parent` component manages the `count` state.
- The `Child` receives `count` as a prop.
- When the button is clicked, `setCount` updates the state in the parent, which causes the parent (and child) to re-render with the new prop value.

### Key Points

- **Props cannot be updated by the child component.**
- To "update" a prop, update the state in the parent and pass the new value down.
- If a child needs to request a prop change, it can call a callback function provided by the parent.

**Summary:**  
Props are immutable in the child. To update them, change the value in the parent component and pass the updated value as a prop.



## 63. What is Web Components? Can Web Components be used in React?

### What are Web Components?

Web Components are a set of standardized browser APIs that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated custom HTML elements. The main technologies behind Web Components are:

- **Custom Elements:** Define new HTML tags with custom behavior.
- **Shadow DOM:** Encapsulate styles and markup, preventing them from leaking out or being affected by the rest of the page.
- **HTML Templates:** Define reusable chunks of markup that are not rendered until used.

Web Components work natively in modern browsers and can be used with or without frameworks.

### Can Web Components be used in React?

Yes, React can interoperate with Web Components. You can use custom elements (Web Components) inside React components just like regular HTML elements. However, there are some caveats:

- **Props and Attributes:** React passes props as attributes to custom elements. For non-string properties or custom events, you may need to use refs or the `ref` callback to interact directly with the DOM node.
- **Events:** Web Components often use custom events. To listen for these in React, attach event listeners using refs and `addEventListener`, as React does not automatically map custom events to props.

#### Example: Using a Web Component in React

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    const customElRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const handleCustomEvent = (e) => {
            console.log('Custom event received:', e.detail);
        };
        const el = customElRef.current;
        el.addEventListener('my-event', handleCustomEvent);
        return () => el.removeEventListener('my-event', handleCustomEvent);
    }, []);

    return <my-custom-element ref={customElRef} some-attr="value"></my-custom-element>;
}
```

### Summary

- Web Components are browser-native custom elements with encapsulated logic and styles.
- You can use Web Components in React, but handling custom properties and events may require direct DOM access via refs.
- This allows integration of third-party or legacy Web Components within React applications.



## 64. Why is the `prop-types` library used? Explain with example.

### Why use `prop-types`?

The `prop-types` library is used in React to perform **runtime type checking** for component props. It helps catch bugs by ensuring that components receive props of the expected type, and provides warnings in the console during development if the types do not match.

### Benefits

- **Early Error Detection:** Warns developers if a component receives props of the wrong type.
- **Documentation:** Serves as a form of documentation for expected prop types.
- **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to understand and maintain code, especially in large projects.

### How to use `prop-types`

1. Install the library:
    ```bash
    npm install prop-types
    ```

2. Import and define prop types in your component:

    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

    function Greeting({ name, age }) {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
                <p>Age: {age}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }

    Greeting.propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        age: PropTypes.number,
    };

    Greeting.defaultProps = {
        age: 18,
    };

    export default Greeting;
    ```

    - `name` must be a string and is required.
    - `age` is an optional number with a default value of 18.

### Example Usage

```jsx
<Greeting name="Alice" age={25} />      // OK
<Greeting name={42} />                  // Warning: Invalid prop `name` of type `number` supplied to `Greeting`, expected `string`.
<Greeting />                            // Warning: The prop `name` is marked as required in `Greeting`, but its value is `undefined`.
```

**Summary:**  
The `prop-types` library is used to validate the types of props passed to React components at runtime, helping catch bugs and improving code quality.


## 65. What can you do to split the reducers? Explain with example.

### Why split reducers?

In Redux, as your application grows, a single reducer function can become large and difficult to manage. Splitting reducers allows you to organize state management logic by domain or feature, making your codebase more modular and maintainable.

### How to split reducers

Redux provides a utility called `combineReducers` that lets you split your reducer logic into separate functions, each managing its own part of the state. Each reducer handles a slice of the overall state tree.

### Example

Suppose you have two domains: `user` and `posts`.

```js
// userReducer.js
const initialUserState = { name: '', loggedIn: false };

function userReducer(state = initialUserState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'LOGIN':
            return { ...state, name: action.payload, loggedIn: true };
        case 'LOGOUT':
            return { ...state, name: '', loggedIn: false };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

// postsReducer.js
const initialPostsState = { items: [] };

function postsReducer(state = initialPostsState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'ADD_POST':
            return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
```

Now, combine them in your store setup:

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';
import userReducer from './userReducer';
import postsReducer from './postsReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    user: userReducer,
    posts: postsReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

The state shape will be:

```js
{
    user: { name: '', loggedIn: false },
    posts: { items: [] }
}
```

### Summary

Splitting reducers with `combineReducers` helps organize Redux logic by feature or domain, making large applications easier to scale and maintain.



## 66. Explain the windowing technique.

### What is the windowing technique?

The windowing technique (also known as "virtualization") is a performance optimization strategy used in React and other UI frameworks to efficiently render large lists or grids. Instead of rendering all items at once, windowing only renders the visible subset of items (the "window") plus a small buffer, reducing the number of DOM nodes and improving performance.

### Why use windowing?

- **Performance:** Rendering thousands of DOM elements can slow down the browser and degrade user experience. Windowing keeps the DOM lightweight by only rendering what's visible.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Reduces memory usage by not mounting off-screen components.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Improves scroll performance in large lists or tables.

### How does windowing work?

- The component calculates which items are visible based on the scroll position and viewport size.
- Only those items (and a small buffer before/after) are rendered.
- As the user scrolls, the window shifts and new items are rendered while off-screen items are removed from the DOM.

### Popular Libraries

- [`react-window`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window): Lightweight and flexible for lists, grids, and tables.
- [`react-virtualized`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized): Feature-rich, supports tables, grids, lists, and more.

### Example with `react-window`

```jsx
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const items = Array(10000).fill().map((_, i) => `Item ${i}`);

function Row({ index, style }) {
    return <div style={style}>{items[index]}</div>;
}

function VirtualizedList() {
    return (
        <List
            height={400}
            itemCount={items.length}
            itemSize={35}
            width={300}
        >
            {Row}
        </List>
    );
}
```

- Only the visible rows are rendered, even though the list contains 10,000 items.

### Summary

The windowing technique optimizes rendering of large lists or grids by only mounting visible items, leading to better performance and user experience in React applications.


## 67. How can you fetch data with React Hooks?

You can fetch data in React functional components using the `useEffect` hook for side effects and the `useState` hook to manage the fetched data and loading/error states.

### Example: Fetching Data with Hooks

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DataFetcher() {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
            .then((response) => {
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                }
                return response.json();
            })
            .then((json) => {
                setData(json);
                setLoading(false);
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                setError(err.message);
                setLoading(false);
            });
    }, []); // Empty dependency array: runs once on mount

    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

    return (
        <div>
            <h3>{data.title}</h3>
            <p>{data.body}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default DataFetcher;
```

### Key Points

- Use `useEffect` to perform the fetch when the component mounts.
- Use `useState` to store the data, loading, and error states.
- Always handle loading and error states for a better user experience.

**Summary:**  
To fetch data with React Hooks, use `useEffect` for the side effect and `useState` to manage the data and status. This pattern is standard for data fetching in functional components.



## 68. List and explain the most used form handling libraries in React

React provides basic form handling out of the box, but for complex forms, validation, and better developer experience, several libraries are widely used:

### 1. Formik

- **Description:** One of the most popular form libraries for React, Formik simplifies form state management, validation, and submission.
- **Features:** Easy integration with Yup for schema-based validation, field-level validation, form context, and helpers for handling form events.
- **Example:**
    ```jsx
    import { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from 'formik';
    import * as Yup from 'yup';

    const SignupSchema = Yup.object().shape({
        email: Yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Required'),
    });

    function SignupForm() {
        return (
            <Formik
                initialValues={{ email: '' }}
                validationSchema={SignupSchema}
                onSubmit={values => console.log(values)}
            >
                <Form>
                    <Field name="email" type="email" />
                    <ErrorMessage name="email" component="div" />
                    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                </Form>
            </Formik>
        );
    }
    ```

### 2. React Hook Form

- **Description:** A performant, minimal form library that leverages React hooks for form state and validation.
- **Features:** Uncontrolled inputs by default, minimal re-renders, easy integration with validation libraries like Yup or Zod.
- **Example:**
    ```jsx
    import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

    function MyForm() {
        const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm();
        const onSubmit = data => console.log(data);

        return (
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
                <input {...register('email', { required: 'Email required' })} />
                {errors.email && <span>{errors.email.message}</span>}
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>
        );
    }
    ```

### 3. React Final Form

- **Description:** A flexible form library with a focus on subscriptions and performance, inspired by Redux Form but without Redux dependency.
- **Features:** Field-level subscriptions, easy validation, and minimal re-renders.
- **Example:**
    ```jsx
    import { Form, Field } from 'react-final-form';

    function SimpleForm() {
        const onSubmit = values => console.log(values);

        return (
            <Form
                onSubmit={onSubmit}
                render={({ handleSubmit }) => (
                    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                        <Field name="email">
                            {({ input, meta }) => (
                                <div>
                                    <input {...input} type="email" placeholder="Email" />
                                    {meta.error && meta.touched && <span>{meta.error}</span>}
                                </div>
                            )}
                        </Field>
                        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                    </form>
                )}
            />
        );
    }
    ```

### 4. Redux Form (Deprecated)

- **Description:** Used to be a popular choice for forms with Redux integration, but now considered legacy and not recommended for new projects.
- **Note:** Prefer Formik, React Hook Form, or React Final Form for new applications.

### 5. Other Notable Libraries

- **Yup, Zod:** Not form libraries, but commonly used for schema-based validation with the above libraries.
- **react-jsonschema-form:** For generating forms from JSON schema definitions.

**Summary Table:**

| Library            | Approach         | Validation Support | Performance | Notes                        |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Formik             | Controlled      | Yup, custom       | Good        | Easy to use, popular         |

| React Final Form   | Controlled      | Custom            | Excellent   | Field subscriptions          |
| Redux Form         | Controlled      | Custom            | OK          | Deprecated, avoid for new    |

**Summary:**  
Formik, React Hook Form, and React Final Form are the most widely used form libraries in React, each offering unique features for form state management and validation. Choose based on your project's needs and preferred API style.


## 69. List and explain some middleware choices for tackling asynchronous calls in Redux.

Redux middleware extends the store's capabilities and is commonly used to handle asynchronous logic such as API calls. Here are some popular middleware choices for managing async actions in Redux:

### 1. **redux-thunk**

- **Description:** The most widely used middleware for async logic in Redux. It allows you to write action creators that return a function (thunk) instead of an action object. The thunk can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous operations.
- **Use Case:** Simple async flows, API requests, conditional dispatching.
- **Example:**
    ```js
    // Action creator with redux-thunk
    export function fetchData() {
        return async (dispatch) => {
            dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });
            try {
                const response = await fetch('/api/data');
                const data = await response.json();
                dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });
            } catch (error) {
                dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error });
            }
        };
    }
    ```

### 2. **redux-saga**

- **Description:** Uses generator functions to manage complex async flows and side effects. Sagas listen for dispatched actions and can perform async tasks, manage concurrency, and coordinate multiple actions.
- **Use Case:** Complex async workflows, background tasks, debouncing, polling, and more advanced side effects.
- **Example:**
    ```js
    import { call, put, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

    function* fetchDataSaga() {
        try {
            const response = yield call(fetch, '/api/data');
            const data = yield response.json();
            yield put({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });
        } catch (error) {
            yield put({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error });
        }
    }

    function* rootSaga() {
        yield takeEvery('FETCH_START', fetchDataSaga);
    }
    ```

### 3. **redux-observable**

- **Description:** Uses RxJS observables to handle async actions as streams. Epics listen for actions and return new actions, enabling powerful composition and cancellation of async flows.
- **Use Case:** Complex async logic, real-time data, event streams, and when you want to leverage RxJS operators.
- **Example:**
    ```js
    import { ofType } from 'redux-observable';
    import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';
    import { map, catchError, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';
    import { of } from 'rxjs';

    const fetchDataEpic = action$ => action$.pipe(
        ofType('FETCH_START'),
        switchMap(() =>
            ajax.getJSON('/api/data').pipe(
                map(response => ({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: response })),
                catchError(error => of({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error }))
            )
        )
    );
    ```

### 4. **redux-promise / redux-promise-middleware**

- **Description:** Allows you to dispatch promises as actions. The middleware automatically dispatches pending, fulfilled, and rejected actions based on the promise state.
- **Use Case:** Simple promise-based async flows.
- **Example:**
    ```js
    // Action creator returns a promise as payload
    const fetchData = () => ({
        type: 'FETCH_DATA',
        payload: fetch('/api/data').then(res => res.json())
    });
    // Middleware dispatches FETCH_DATA_PENDING, FETCH_DATA_FULFILLED, FETCH_DATA_REJECTED
    ```

### Comparison Table

| Middleware         | Approach         | Complexity | Best For                        |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| redux-thunk        | Functions       | Low        | Simple async logic, API calls    |
| redux-saga         | Generators      | Medium/High| Complex workflows, side effects  |
| redux-observable   | Observables     | High       | Streams, real-time, RxJS users   |
| redux-promise      | Promises        | Low        | Simple promise-based actions     |

**Summary:**  
- Use **redux-thunk** for most simple async needs.
- Use **redux-saga** or **redux-observable** for complex, coordinated, or real-time async flows.
- **redux-promise** is suitable for basic promise-based actions.

Choose middleware based on your application's complexity and preferred async programming style.



## 70. What is one-way data flow in React?

### What is One-Way Data Flow?

One-way data flow in React means that data moves in a single direction—from parent components down to child components via props. Child components cannot directly modify the data they receive; instead, they can communicate changes back to the parent using callback functions provided as props.

### Why is One-Way Data Flow Important?

- **Predictability:** Makes it easier to understand how data changes affect the UI.
- **Debugging:** Simplifies tracking the source of data and state changes.
- **Maintainability:** Reduces side effects and unintended data mutations.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Parent Component:** Holds the state and passes data to children via props.
2. **Child Component:** Receives data as props and can request changes by calling callback functions from the parent.
3. **State Update:** The parent updates its state, causing a re-render and passing new props to children.

#### Example

```jsx
function Parent() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

    return <Child count={count} onIncrement={() => setCount(count + 1)} />;
}

function Child({ count, onIncrement }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

- The `Parent` manages the `count` state.
- The `Child` receives `count` and `onIncrement` as props.
- When the button is clicked, `onIncrement` notifies the parent to update the state.

**Summary:**  
One-way data flow ensures data moves from parent to child, making React apps easier to reason about and maintain.


## 71. Explain concurrent rendering.

### What is Concurrent Rendering in React?

Concurrent rendering is a feature in React that allows the rendering process to be interruptible, enabling React to work on multiple tasks simultaneously and prioritize more urgent updates (like user input) over less critical ones (like data fetching or background updates). This leads to smoother, more responsive user interfaces.

### Why is Concurrent Rendering Important?

- **Responsiveness:** Keeps the UI interactive even during heavy computations or large updates.
- **Prioritization:** Lets React pause, resume, or abandon rendering work to handle higher-priority tasks first.
- **Better User Experience:** Reduces UI blocking and jank, especially in complex or data-intensive apps.

### How Does Concurrent Rendering Work?

- React breaks rendering work into small units.
- If a higher-priority update (like a keystroke) comes in, React can pause the current work, handle the urgent update, and then resume.
- This is enabled by React's Fiber architecture and APIs like `startTransition`, `useTransition`, and `useDeferredValue`.

### Example

```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function SearchList({ items }) {
    const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
    const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

    const handleChange = (e) => {
        const value = e.target.value;
        startTransition(() => {
            setQuery(value);
        });
    };

    const filtered = items.filter(item => item.includes(query));

    return (
        <div>
            <input onChange={handleChange} />
            {isPending && <span>Loading...</span>}
            <ul>
                {filtered.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
```
- `useTransition` marks the update as non-urgent, allowing React to keep the UI responsive.

### Key Points

- Concurrent rendering is opt-in and backward compatible.
- It powers features like Suspense, transitions, and deferred updates.
- Available in React 18+.

**Summary:**  
Concurrent rendering lets React interrupt and prioritize rendering work, resulting in more responsive and fluid user interfaces, especially in complex applications.


## 72. Explain MobX. What, When, Why, How?

### What is MobX?

MobX is a state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with React. It enables automatic and efficient state updates by using observable data and reactive programming principles. MobX tracks dependencies and ensures that any component or computation using observable data is automatically updated when that data changes.

### When should you use MobX?

- When you want simple, scalable, and automatic state management.
- When your app requires fine-grained reactivity and minimal boilerplate.
- When you prefer mutable state and want to avoid the strict immutability and boilerplate of Redux.
- For medium to large applications where state is shared across many components.

### Why use MobX?

- **Simplicity:** Minimal setup and boilerplate compared to Redux.
- **Automatic Tracking:** MobX automatically tracks which data is used by which components, updating only what’s necessary.
- **Performance:** Efficient updates due to fine-grained reactivity.
- **Mutable State:** Allows direct mutation of state, making code more straightforward.
- **Scalability:** Works well for both small and large applications.

### How does MobX work?

1. **Observables:** Mark state as observable using `makeAutoObservable`, `observable`, or decorators.
2. **Actions:** Define actions (functions) that modify observable state.
3. **Reactions/Observers:** Components or functions that use observable data automatically re-render or re-run when the data changes.

#### Example with React

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { makeAutoObservable } from 'mobx';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';

// Store
class CounterStore {
    count = 0;
    constructor() {
        makeAutoObservable(this);
    }
    increment() {
        this.count += 1;
    }
}
const counterStore = new CounterStore();

// Component
const Counter = observer(() => (
    <div>
        <p>Count: {counterStore.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => counterStore.increment()}>Increment</button>
    </div>
));

export default Counter;
```

- The `Counter` component automatically re-renders when `counterStore.count` changes.

### Summary

MobX is a simple, efficient, and scalable state management library that uses observables and reactivity. Use it when you want automatic updates, minimal boilerplate, and mutable state in your React applications.


## 73. What is the use of the ESLint plugin for hooks?

The ESLint plugin for hooks (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`) is a tool that enforces the rules of React Hooks in your codebase. It helps catch common mistakes and ensures that hooks are used correctly, preventing bugs related to improper usage.

### Key Uses

- **Enforces Rules of Hooks:**  
    Ensures hooks are only called at the top level of React functions and not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

- **Checks Hook Dependencies:**  
    Warns if dependencies are missing or unnecessary in the dependency array of hooks like `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`.

- **Prevents Common Bugs:**  
    Helps avoid subtle bugs caused by incorrect hook usage, such as stale closures or missed updates.

### Example

If you forget to include a dependency in a `useEffect`:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    // uses 'value', but 'value' is not in the dependency array
    doSomething(value);
}, []); // ESLint will warn about missing 'value'
```

The plugin will show a warning, prompting you to add `value` to the dependency array.

### How to Use

1. Install the plugin:
        ```bash
        npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
        ```

2. Add to your ESLint configuration:
        ```json
        {
            "plugins": ["react-hooks"],
            "rules": {
                "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
                "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
            }
        }
        ```

### Summary

The ESLint plugin for hooks helps maintain correct and consistent usage of React Hooks, reducing bugs and improving code quality by enforcing best practices automatically.

## 74. What is render hijacking?

### What is Render Hijacking?

Render hijacking is an advanced React pattern where a component can control or modify the rendering output of another component. This is typically achieved using higher-order components (HOCs) that wrap a target component and alter its rendering behavior, such as by conditionally rendering different elements, injecting props, or preventing rendering altogether.

### How does Render Hijacking work?

A higher-order component receives the original component as an argument, and within its own render method, it can decide what to render based on props, state, or other logic. This allows the HOC to "hijack" or override the rendering process of the wrapped component.

#### Example

```jsx
function withRenderHijack(WrappedComponent) {
    return function(props) {
        if (props.shouldHide) {
            return null; // Prevent rendering
        }
        // Modify props or rendering as needed
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} extraProp="Injected!" />;
    };
}

function MyComponent({ extraProp }) {
    return <div>{extraProp}</div>;
}

const HijackedComponent = withRenderHijack(MyComponent);

// <HijackedComponent shouldHide={true} /> will render nothing
// <HijackedComponent shouldHide={false} /> will render <div>Injected!</div>
```

### Use Cases

- Conditionally rendering or blocking components
- Injecting additional props or logic
- Logging, analytics, or debugging
- Implementing permissions or feature toggles

### Key Points

- Render hijacking is most commonly implemented with HOCs.
- It allows for flexible and reusable logic that can alter how components render.
- Use with care, as it can make component behavior less predictable.

**Summary:**  
Render hijacking refers to intercepting and modifying the rendering process of a component, usually via higher-order components, to control what gets rendered based on custom logic.


## 75. Explain `React.memo` function

### What is `React.memo`?

`React.memo` is a higher-order component (HOC) in React that memoizes a functional component. It optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the component's props have not changed.

### How does `React.memo` work?

When you wrap a functional component with `React.memo`, React will compare the current props with the previous props using a shallow comparison. If the props are the same, React skips rendering the component and reuses the last rendered result.

### Syntax

```jsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
```

You can also provide a custom comparison function as the second argument to control when the component should update:

```jsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    // return true if props are equal, false otherwise
});
```

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Greeting = React.memo(function Greeting({ name }) {
    console.log('Rendering Greeting');
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
});

function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <Greeting name="Alice" />
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

- In this example, clicking the button increments the count, but `Greeting` does not re-render because its `name` prop does not change.

### When should you use `React.memo`?

- For functional components that render the same output for the same props.
- When child components receive props that rarely change, and you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### Key Points

- `React.memo` only works for functional components.
- It performs a shallow comparison of props by default.
- Use with care; unnecessary memoization can add complexity without performance benefit.

**Summary:**  
`React.memo` is used to memoize functional components, preventing re-renders when props have not changed, and is useful for optimizing performance in React applications.


## 76. How do uncaught errors behave in React?

### What happens when an error is not caught in React?

When a JavaScript error occurs during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in a constructor of any component, and it is not caught by an error boundary, React will unmount the entire component tree below the component where the error occurred. This means:

- The affected part of the UI disappears.
- No fallback UI is shown unless an error boundary is present.
- The error is logged to the console in development mode.

### How to handle uncaught errors?

To prevent the entire app from crashing or disappearing, wrap parts of your component tree with an [Error Boundary](#20-what-are-error-boundaries-in-react-what-when-how-why). Error boundaries catch errors in their child components and display a fallback UI instead of unmounting everything.

### Example

If no error boundary is present:

```jsx
function BuggyComponent() {
    throw new Error('Oops!');
    return <div>This will not render</div>;
}

function App() {
    return <BuggyComponent />;
}
```
- The entire UI will unmount, and you'll see an error in the console.

With an error boundary:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
    <BuggyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```
- The error boundary catches the error and displays a fallback UI.

### Summary

Uncaught errors in React cause the affected component subtree to unmount and disappear. Use error boundaries to catch errors and display a fallback UI, improving user experience and app stability.


## 77. What are default props?

### What are Default Props?

Default props in React are values that a component uses for its props if no value is provided by the parent component. They help ensure that components have sensible fallback values and behave predictably even when some props are omitted.

### How to Define Default Props

- **Functional Components:**  
    Assign default values using ES6 default parameters.

    ```jsx
    function Greeting({ name = "Guest" }) {
            return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
    }
    ```

- **Class Components:**  
    Use the `defaultProps` static property.

    ```jsx
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
            static defaultProps = {
                    name: "Guest"
            };
            render() {
                    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
            }
    }
    ```

### Why Use Default Props?

- Prevents `undefined` values and errors when props are missing.
- Simplifies component usage by not requiring all props every time.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.

### Example Usage

```jsx
<Greeting />           // Renders: Hello, Guest!
<Greeting name="Bob"/> // Renders: Hello, Bob!
```

**Summary:**  
Default props provide fallback values for component props, ensuring reliable and predictable component behavior when some props are not supplied.



## 78. What is React DevTools?

### What is React DevTools?

React DevTools is a browser extension and standalone tool that allows developers to inspect, debug, and profile React applications. It provides a visual interface for exploring the component tree, viewing props and state, monitoring performance, and tracking component updates in real time.

### Key Features

- **Component Tree Inspection:** Visualize the hierarchy of React components, including their props, state, and hooks.
- **State and Props Debugging:** View and edit component state and props directly from the DevTools panel.
- **Performance Profiling:** Profile component rendering performance to identify slow components and optimize rendering.
- **Highlight Updates:** See which components re-render in response to state or prop changes.
- **Hooks Inspection:** Inspect the values of React hooks in functional components.

### How to Use React DevTools

1. **Installation:**
    - Available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
    - Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/).

2. **Usage:**
    - Open your app in the browser.
    - Open the browser's developer tools and look for the "⚛️ Components" and "⚛️ Profiler" tabs.
    - Explore the component tree, inspect props/state, and use the profiler to analyze performance.

### Why Use React DevTools?

- **Debugging:** Easily track down bugs by inspecting component state and props.
- **Optimization:** Identify unnecessary re-renders and performance bottlenecks.
- **Development Efficiency:** Quickly understand the structure and data flow of your React app.

**Summary:**  
React DevTools is an essential tool for React developers, providing powerful features for inspecting, debugging, and optimizing React applications directly in the browser.


## 79. On what condition does component props default to true?

In React, if you use a boolean prop without assigning it a value, it defaults to `true`. This is similar to how HTML attributes work (e.g., `<input disabled />` means `disabled={true}`).

### Example

```jsx
function Button({ primary }) {
    return <button>{primary ? "Primary" : "Default"}</button>;
}

// Usage
<Button primary />        // primary is true
<Button primary={true} /> // primary is true
<Button primary={false}/> // primary is false
<Button />                // primary is undefined
```

- `<Button primary />` sets `primary` to `true`.
- `<Button />` leaves `primary` as `undefined` (not `true`).

**Summary:**  
A prop defaults to `true` when it is present without a value (e.g., `<Component prop />`). If omitted, it is `undefined`.




## 80. How will you make Redux Form initial values get updated from state?

When using Redux Form (or similar form libraries), the `initialValues` prop is used to set the initial values of the form fields. By default, Redux Form only sets the initial values when the form is first initialized. If you want the form to update its initial values when the Redux state changes (for example, when loading data asynchronously), you need to enable the `enableReinitialize` prop.

### Steps

1. **Pass `initialValues` from Redux state:**  
    Map the desired state to the `initialValues` prop of your form component.

2. **Set `enableReinitialize` to `true`:**  
    This tells Redux Form to reinitialize the form whenever `initialValues` changes.

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { reduxForm, Field } from 'redux-form';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

let MyForm = ({ handleSubmit }) => (
     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <Field name="name" component="input" type="text" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </form>
);

MyForm = reduxForm({
     form: 'myForm',
     enableReinitialize: true, // <-- important!
})(MyForm);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
     initialValues: state.userData, // <-- comes from Redux state
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MyForm);
```

- Whenever `state.userData` changes, the form will reinitialize with the new values.

### Summary

To update Redux Form's initial values from state, pass the latest values as `initialValues` and set `enableReinitialize: true` in the form configuration. This ensures the form reflects changes in the Redux state.


## 81. How will you use TypeScript in Create React App?

You can use TypeScript with Create React App (CRA) to add static typing to your React projects. CRA provides built-in support for TypeScript, making setup straightforward.

### Creating a New React App with TypeScript

Run the following command to create a new React app with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

- This sets up a new project with TypeScript configuration and `.tsx`/`.ts` files.

### Adding TypeScript to an Existing CRA Project

If you already have a CRA project, add TypeScript and type definitions:

```bash
npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

- Rename your files from `.js`/`.jsx` to `.ts`/`.tsx` as needed.
- CRA will automatically detect TypeScript and create a `tsconfig.json` file.

### Key Points

- Use `.tsx` for files containing JSX, `.ts` for plain TypeScript.
- TypeScript provides static type checking, better editor support, and early error detection.
- CRA handles TypeScript compilation and configuration out of the box.

**Summary:**  
Use the `--template typescript` flag when creating a new CRA project, or install TypeScript and type definitions in an existing project to enable TypeScript support in Create React App.



## 82. What are the steps to add Font Awesome icons in React?

Font Awesome provides a popular icon library that can be easily integrated into React applications using the official `react-fontawesome` package.

### Steps to Add Font Awesome Icons in React

1. **Install Font Awesome Packages**

Install the core Font Awesome packages and the icon packs you need (e.g., free solid icons):

```bash
npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
```

You can also install other icon packs, such as `@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons` or `@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`, as needed.

2. **Import the Icon and Component**

Import the `FontAwesomeIcon` component and the specific icons you want to use:

```jsx
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import { faCoffee } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
```

3. **Use the Icon in Your Component**

Render the icon using the `FontAwesomeIcon` component and pass the icon as a prop:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <div>
            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} />
            <span>Coffee Time!</span>
        </div>
    );
}
```

4. **(Optional) Add More Icons**

Import and use additional icons as needed:

```jsx
import { faUser } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faUser} />
```

### Summary

- Install the required Font Awesome packages.
- Import `FontAwesomeIcon` and the icons you need.
- Use the `<FontAwesomeIcon icon={...} />` component in your JSX.

For more details and advanced usage, refer to the [Font Awesome React documentation](https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs/web/use-with/react/).



## 83. How will you create an image slider using React JS?

To create an image slider (carousel) in React, you can use state to track the current image index and update it with navigation buttons or automatic transitions. Here’s a simple example:

### Example: Basic Image Slider

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const images = [
    'https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Image+1',
    'https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Image+2',
    'https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Image+3',
];

function ImageSlider() {
    const [current, setCurrent] = useState(0);

    const nextSlide = () => setCurrent((current + 1) % images.length);
    const prevSlide = () => setCurrent((current - 1 + images.length) % images.length);

    return (
        <div>
            <img src={images[current]} alt={`Slide ${current + 1}`} style={{ width: '400px', height: '200px' }} />
            <div>
                <button onClick={prevSlide}>Previous</button>
                <button onClick={nextSlide}>Next</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ImageSlider;
```

### How it works:
- Store image URLs in an array.
- Use `useState` to track the current image index.
- Update the index with "Next" and "Previous" buttons, wrapping around at the ends.
- Render the current image.

### Tips:
- For auto-sliding, use `useEffect` with `setInterval`.
- For production, consider libraries like [react-slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) or [swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/react).

**Summary:**  
Create an image slider in React by managing the current image index in state and updating it with navigation controls. For advanced features, use a carousel library.


## 84. How will you build a search filter using React?

To build a search filter in React, you typically use state to track the search input and filter a list of items based on that input. Here’s a simple example:

### Example: Search Filter Component

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const items = [
    'Apple',
    'Banana',
    'Orange',
    'Grape',
    'Pineapple',
    'Mango',
];

function SearchFilter() {
    const [query, setQuery] = useState('');

    const filteredItems = items.filter(item =>
        item.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
    );

    return (
        <div>
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Search..."
                value={query}
                onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)}
            />
            <ul>
                {filteredItems.map(item => (
                    <li key={item}>{item}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}

export default SearchFilter;
```

### How it works:
- Store the search query in state using `useState`.
- Filter the list of items based on the query (case-insensitive).
- Update the query as the user types in the input field.
- Render the filtered list.

**Summary:**  
To build a search filter in React, manage the search input in state and filter your data based on the input value, updating the displayed list as the user types.


## 85. Create a simple counter using React

### Example: Functional Component Counter

You can create a simple counter in React using the `useState` hook to manage the count value.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

**How it works:**
- `useState(0)` initializes the counter at 0.
- The `Increment` button increases the count by 1.
- The `Decrement` button decreases the count by 1.
- The `Reset` button sets the count back to 0.

This is a basic example of state management and event handling in a React functional component.


## 86. How do you handle events in React?

### Handling Events in React

React handles events using a syntax similar to HTML, but with some important differences:

- Event names are camelCase (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`), not lowercase.
- Event handlers are passed as functions, not strings.

### Example: Handling a Click Event

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ClickButton() {
    const handleClick = () => {
        alert('Button clicked!');
    };

    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Click Me
        </button>
    );
}

export default ClickButton;
```

- The `onClick` prop attaches the `handleClick` function to the button.

### Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

You can pass arguments to event handlers using an arrow function:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => handleClick('Hello')}>Click</button>
```

### Synthetic Events

React wraps native browser events in a cross-browser wrapper called a **SyntheticEvent**. This ensures consistent behavior across browsers.

### Preventing Default Behavior

Use `event.preventDefault()` in your handler to prevent default actions:

```jsx
function Form() {
    const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        // Custom logic
    };

    return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</form>;
}
```

**Summary:**  
Handle events in React by passing functions to event props (like `onClick`). React normalizes events for cross-browser compatibility using SyntheticEvent.


## 87. How do you handle forms in React? Explain with a production-grade form with proper input validation and submission.

### Handling Forms in React

In React, forms are typically managed as **controlled components**, where form input values are tied to component state. This approach allows for real-time validation, conditional rendering, and easy form submission handling.

For production-grade forms, it's common to use a form library like **Formik** or **React Hook Form** for robust state management and validation, often in combination with a schema validation library like **Yup**.

### Example: Production-Grade Form with Formik and Yup

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from 'formik';
import * as Yup from 'yup';

// Validation schema using Yup
const SignupSchema = Yup.object().shape({
    name: Yup.string()
        .min(2, 'Name too short')
        .max(50, 'Name too long')
        .required('Name is required'),
    email: Yup.string()
        .email('Invalid email')
        .required('Email is required'),
    password: Yup.string()
        .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
        .required('Password is required'),
});

function SignupForm() {
    return (
        <Formik
            initialValues={{ name: '', email: '', password: '' }}
            validationSchema={SignupSchema}
            onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting, resetForm }) => {
                // Simulate API call
                setTimeout(() => {
                    alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
                    setSubmitting(false);
                    resetForm();
                }, 1000);
            }}
        >
            {({ isSubmitting }) => (
                <Form>
                    <div>
                        <label>Name:</label>
                        <Field name="name" type="text" />
                        <ErrorMessage name="name" component="div" style={{ color: 'red' }} />
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <label>Email:</label>
                        <Field name="email" type="email" />
                        <ErrorMessage name="email" component="div" style={{ color: 'red' }} />
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <label>Password:</label>
                        <Field name="password" type="password" />
                        <ErrorMessage name="password" component="div" style={{ color: 'red' }} />
                    </div>
                    <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
                        {isSubmitting ? 'Submitting...' : 'Sign Up'}
                    </button>
                </Form>
            )}
        </Formik>
    );
}

export default SignupForm;
```

### Key Features

- **Controlled Inputs:** All fields are managed by Formik's state.
- **Validation:** Yup schema provides declarative, robust validation.
- **Error Display:** Validation errors are shown next to each field.
- **Submission:** Handles async submission and disables the button while submitting.
- **Reset:** Form resets after successful submission.

### Why use Form Libraries and Schema Validation?

- **Scalability:** Easily manage complex forms with many fields.
- **Validation:** Centralized, reusable validation logic.
- **User Experience:** Real-time feedback and error handling.
- **Maintainability:** Cleaner, more maintainable code.

**Summary:**  
For production-grade forms in React, use a form library (like Formik or React Hook Form) with a schema validation tool (like Yup) to manage state, validate inputs, and handle submission robustly and efficiently.


## 88. Explain a simple React form example with plain React, including validation and submission.

You can build a simple form in React using only state and event handlers, without any external libraries. Here’s an example of a contact form with basic validation and submission handling:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ContactForm() {
    const [values, setValues] = useState({ name: '', email: '' });
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const validate = () => {
        const newErrors = {};
        if (!values.name.trim()) newErrors.name = 'Name is required';
        if (!values.email) {
            newErrors.email = 'Email is required';
        } else if (!/\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(values.email)) {
            newErrors.email = 'Email is invalid';
        }
        return newErrors;
    };

    const handleChange = (e) => {
        setValues({ ...values, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const validationErrors = validate();
        setErrors(validationErrors);
        if (Object.keys(validationErrors).length === 0) {
            // Simulate form submission
            setSubmitted(true);
        }
    };

    if (submitted) {
        return <p>Thank you for contacting us, {values.name}!</p>;
    }

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate>
            <div>
                <label>Name:</label>
                <input
                    type="text"
                    name="name"
                    value={values.name}
                    onChange={handleChange}
                />
                {errors.name && <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>{errors.name}</span>}
            </div>
            <div>
                <label>Email:</label>
                <input
                    type="email"
                    name="email"
                    value={values.email}
                    onChange={handleChange}
                />
                {errors.email && <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>{errors.email}</span>}
            </div>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}

export default ContactForm;
```

**How it works:**
- State tracks input values and errors.
- `validate` checks for required fields and a valid email format.
- On submit, validation runs and errors are displayed if present.
- If valid, a thank-you message is shown.

**Summary:**  
A simple React form can be built using state for values and errors, with validation and submission handled in plain React—no libraries required.

## 89. How do you optimize performance in React applications?

Optimizing performance in React applications involves minimizing unnecessary renders, reducing bundle size, and ensuring smooth user interactions. Here are key strategies:

### 1. Prevent Unnecessary Re-renders

- **Use `React.memo`** for functional components to memoize output and avoid re-rendering when props haven't changed.
- **Use `PureComponent`** for class components to perform shallow prop/state comparison.
- **Implement `shouldComponentUpdate`** in class components for custom update logic.

### 2. Memoize Expensive Calculations and Callbacks

- **`useMemo`**: Memoize expensive computed values.
- **`useCallback`**: Memoize functions passed as props to prevent child re-renders.

### 3. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

- **`React.lazy`** and **`Suspense`**: Load components only when needed.
- **Dynamic imports**: Split code at route or component level to reduce initial bundle size.

### 4. Optimize Lists

- Use **windowing/virtualization** libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` to render only visible list items in large lists.

### 5. Avoid Inline Functions and Objects in JSX

- Move functions and objects outside render or memoize them to prevent new references on each render.

### 6. Optimize Context Usage

- Split context providers to avoid unnecessary re-renders of all consumers when only part of the context changes.

### 7. Use Production Builds

- Always deploy production builds (`npm run build`) for optimized code and smaller bundles.

### 8. Profile and Analyze

- Use **React DevTools Profiler** to identify slow components and unnecessary renders.
- Use browser performance tools to analyze runtime bottlenecks.

### 9. Optimize Images and Assets

- Compress images, use SVGs where appropriate, and leverage lazy loading for images.

### 10. Debounce or Throttle Expensive Operations

- Debounce input handlers (e.g., search filters) to reduce the frequency of updates.

**Summary:**  
Optimize React apps by preventing unnecessary renders, memoizing values and callbacks, splitting code, virtualizing lists, and profiling performance. Use production builds and efficient asset management for the best results.


## 90. What is the purpose of the `shouldComponentUpdate` method? When would you use it? What is its alternative in functional components?

### What is `shouldComponentUpdate`?

`shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method in React class components that determines whether a component should re-render in response to changes in props or state. It is called before the `render()` method and receives the next props and state as arguments.

### Purpose

- **Performance Optimization:**  
    By default, every update to props or state triggers a re-render. `shouldComponentUpdate` allows you to prevent unnecessary renders by returning `false` when the update is not needed, improving performance in large or frequently updating components.

### When would you use it?

- When rendering is expensive and you want to avoid unnecessary updates.
- When you want fine-grained control over re-rendering based on specific prop or state changes.
- In components that receive frequent updates but only need to re-render for certain changes.

#### Example

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
                // Only re-render if the 'value' prop changes
                return nextProps.value !== this.props.value;
        }

        render() {
                return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
        }
}
```

### Alternative in Functional Components

In functional components, the equivalent optimization is achieved using:

- **`React.memo`**: Memoizes the component and skips re-rendering if props haven't changed (shallow comparison by default).
- **Custom comparison function**: Pass a function as the second argument to `React.memo` for custom logic.

#### Example

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ value }) {
        return <div>{value}</div>;
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => prevProps.value === nextProps.value);
```

**Summary:**  
Use `shouldComponentUpdate` in class components to control re-rendering for performance. In functional components, use `React.memo` (with an optional custom comparison) as the alternative.

## 91. Describe the concept of code splitting in React and its benefits.

### What is Code Splitting in React?

Code splitting is a technique that allows you to split your application’s JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks, so users only load the code necessary for the current page or feature. In React, code splitting is typically achieved using dynamic `import()` statements and React’s built-in `React.lazy` and `Suspense` APIs.

### How to Implement Code Splitting

- **Dynamic Imports:** Use `import()` to load modules on demand.
- **React.lazy:** Wrap components with `React.lazy` to defer loading until they are rendered.
- **Suspense:** Use `<Suspense>` to show a fallback UI (like a spinner) while the component is loading.

#### Example

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <LazyComponent />
            </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Benefits of Code Splitting

- **Faster Initial Load:** Only essential code is loaded upfront, reducing initial bundle size and improving load times.
- **On-Demand Loading:** Additional code is loaded as needed, such as when navigating to a new route or feature.
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces memory usage and speeds up rendering, especially in large applications.
- **Better User Experience:** Users see content sooner and experience less waiting for features they may never use.

### When to Use Code Splitting

- For large apps with many routes or features.
- When certain components or libraries are only needed in specific parts of the app.
- To optimize performance and scalability as your app grows.

**Summary:**  
Code splitting in React breaks your app into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, leading to faster load times and better performance, especially for large applications.

## 92. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React? Why is it important?

### What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React?

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique where React components are rendered to HTML on the server, and the resulting HTML is sent to the client. When the browser receives the HTML, it displays the fully rendered page immediately, and then React "hydrates" the page to make it interactive.

In SSR, the initial render happens on the server (using tools like Next.js or frameworks with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`), rather than in the browser.

### Why is SSR Important?

- **Faster Initial Load:** Users see a fully rendered page sooner, improving perceived performance, especially on slow networks or devices.
- **SEO Benefits:** Search engines can crawl and index the pre-rendered HTML, making SSR essential for public-facing sites that rely on organic search traffic.
- **Social Sharing:** Social media platforms can generate rich previews from server-rendered HTML.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Users with JavaScript disabled still see meaningful content.

### How Does SSR Work in React?

1. The server receives a request for a page.
2. React components are rendered to HTML on the server.
3. The server sends the HTML to the client.
4. The browser displays the HTML immediately.
5. React hydrates the page, attaching event listeners and making it interactive.

### Example (with Next.js)

```jsx
// pages/index.js (Next.js automatically enables SSR)
export default function Home() {
    return <h1>Hello, SSR!</h1>;
}
```

### When to Use SSR

- Public websites where SEO and fast initial load are important.
- Content-heavy sites, blogs, e-commerce, and landing pages.

**Summary:**  
SSR in React renders components to HTML on the server, improving load speed, SEO, and user experience. It's commonly used with frameworks like Next.js for optimal results.

## 93. How do you handle authentication and authorization in React applications?

### Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication** is verifying a user's identity (e.g., login).
- **Authorization** is determining what actions or resources a user can access.

### Common Approaches

1. **Token-Based Authentication (JWT/OAuth)**
    - On login, the server returns a token (e.g., JWT).
    - Store the token in memory, `localStorage`, or `sessionStorage`.
    - Attach the token to API requests (usually in the `Authorization` header).

2. **Protected Routes**
    - Use React Router to restrict access to certain routes.
    - Create a wrapper component (e.g., `PrivateRoute`) that checks authentication before rendering the target component.

    ```jsx
    import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

    function PrivateRoute({ children }) {
         const isAuthenticated = !!localStorage.getItem('token');
         return isAuthenticated ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
    }
    // Usage:
    // <Route path="/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoute><Dashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />
    ```

3. **Authorization (Role-Based Access)**
    - Store user roles/permissions after login.
    - Conditionally render UI or restrict routes based on roles.

    ```jsx
    function AdminPanel() {
         const user = useContext(UserContext);
         if (user.role !== 'admin') return <p>Access denied</p>;
         return <div>Admin Content</div>;
    }
    ```

4. **Context or State Management**
    - Use React Context, Redux, or Zustand to store and access authentication state and user info throughout the app.

5. **Logout**
    - Remove the token and user info from storage/context and redirect to login.

### Security Tips

- Never store tokens in plain cookies or localStorage if you need high security; consider HTTP-only cookies for sensitive apps.
- Always validate tokens on the server.
- Protect sensitive routes both on the client and server.

### Summary

Handle authentication in React by storing tokens, protecting routes, and managing user state. Use context or state management for global access, and implement role checks for authorization. Always secure sensitive data and validate on the backend.

## 94. Describe the differences between React class components and functional components with hooks in terms of performance and readability.

### Performance

- **Functional Components with Hooks:**
    - Generally have similar or slightly better performance than class components due to less boilerplate and no need for `this` binding.
    - Hooks enable finer-grained optimizations (e.g., `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`) and work seamlessly with React's concurrent features.
    - Functional components are easier for React to optimize internally, especially with the latest React versions.

- **Class Components:**
    - Require more boilerplate (constructor, method binding).
    - Optimization relies on `shouldComponentUpdate` or `PureComponent`, which can be less intuitive than hooks-based memoization.
    - Slightly more overhead due to class instance creation and method bindings, though the difference is negligible for most apps.

### Readability

- **Functional Components with Hooks:**
    - More concise and declarative; logic is grouped by feature rather than lifecycle methods.
    - No need for `this`, making code easier to read and less error-prone.
    - State and side effects are managed with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), leading to cleaner and more modular code.
    - Easier to extract and reuse logic via custom hooks.

- **Class Components:**
    - More verbose; logic is split across lifecycle methods, making related code harder to follow.
    - Requires understanding of `this` context and method binding.
    - Harder to share stateful logic between components without patterns like higher-order components or render props.

**Summary:**  
Functional components with hooks offer better readability, less boilerplate, and more intuitive performance optimizations compared to class components. They are the recommended approach for modern React development.

## 95. What are some strategies for managing application state in large-scale React applications?

Managing state in large-scale React applications requires scalable, maintainable, and predictable patterns. Here are common strategies:

### 1. **Local State with Hooks**
- Use `useState`, `useReducer`, and `useContext` for component-level or localized state.
- Suitable for UI state, form inputs, and logic that doesn't need to be shared globally.

### 2. **Context API**
- Use React's Context API to share global data (e.g., theme, authentication, user info) across the component tree.
- Best for moderate, infrequently changing global state.
- Split context providers to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 3. **Redux Toolkit**
- Use Redux Toolkit for complex, shared, or frequently updated state.
- Centralizes state in a single store, enabling predictable updates and powerful debugging (Redux DevTools).
- Encourages best practices with slices, thunks, and middleware for async logic.

### 4. **Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, or Other Modern Libraries**
- Lightweight state management libraries like Zustand or Jotai offer simpler APIs and less boilerplate than Redux.
- Good for scalable, modular state with minimal setup.

### 5. **Server State Management**
- Use libraries like React Query or SWR for data fetching, caching, and synchronization with remote APIs.
- Separates server state (fetched data) from client state (UI, form, etc.), reducing complexity.

### 6. **Module-Based State Organization**
- Organize state logic by feature or domain (feature folders, slices, or stores).
- Keeps codebase modular and maintainable as the app grows.

### 7. **State Normalization**
- Normalize complex or relational data structures (e.g., with normalizr) to avoid duplication and simplify updates.

### 8. **Performance Optimization**
- Memoize selectors (e.g., with Reselect) and use memoization hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Use windowing/virtualization for large lists.

### 9. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- Distinguish between UI state (local), app state (global), and server state (remote).
- Use the right tool for each type of state.

**Summary:**  
Combine local state, Context, Redux Toolkit (or modern alternatives), and server state libraries to manage state in large React apps. Organize state by feature, optimize for performance, and choose the right tool for each state type to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## 96. Explain the concept of lazy loading in React and how it can be implemented.

### What is Lazy Loading in React?

Lazy loading is a performance optimization technique where certain parts of your application (such as components or routes) are loaded only when they are needed, rather than at the initial load. This reduces the initial bundle size, speeds up the first render, and improves user experience, especially in large applications.

### How to Implement Lazy Loading in React

React provides built-in support for lazy loading components using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

#### 1. Using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`

- **`React.lazy`**: Allows you to define a component that is loaded dynamically via a function returning an import.
- **`Suspense`**: Wraps the lazy component and displays a fallback (like a spinner) while the component is loading.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <LazyComponent />
            </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
}
```

- `LazyComponent` is loaded only when it is rendered.
- The fallback UI is shown until the component finishes loading.

#### 2. Lazy Loading Routes (with React Router)

You can also lazy load route components for code splitting:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const Home = React.lazy(() => import('./Home'));
const About = React.lazy(() => import('./About'));

function App() {
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading page...</div>}>
                <Routes>
                    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
                </Routes>
            </Suspense>
        </BrowserRouter>
    );
}
```

### Benefits of Lazy Loading

- Reduces initial bundle size and load time.
- Loads code only when needed (on demand).
- Improves performance and user experience.

**Summary:**  
Lazy loading in React defers loading components until they are needed, using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. This optimizes performance by splitting code and reducing the initial load time.



## 97. How would you integrate React with a backend server, such as Node.js or Django?

### Overview

Integrating React with a backend server involves connecting your React frontend to a backend API (such as Node.js/Express or Django) to fetch or send data.

### Common Integration Steps

1. **Backend API Setup**
    - Build RESTful or GraphQL endpoints in your backend (Node.js/Express, Django REST Framework, etc.).
    - Example endpoint: `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/login`.

2. **Frontend API Calls**
    - Use `fetch`, `axios`, or similar libraries in React to make HTTP requests to the backend.
    - Example:
      ```jsx
      import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

      function UserList() {
            const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

            useEffect(() => {
                 fetch('/api/users')
                      .then(res => res.json())
                      .then(data => setUsers(data));
            }, []);

            return (
                 <ul>
                      {users.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>)}
                 </ul>
            );
      }
      ```

3. **CORS Configuration**
    - Enable CORS on your backend to allow requests from your React app (especially during development).
    - Node.js/Express example:
      ```js
      const cors = require('cors');
      app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' }));
      ```
    - Django example (using `django-cors-headers`):
      ```python
      CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
            "http://localhost:3000",
      ]
      ```

4. **Authentication**
    - Implement authentication (JWT, sessions, etc.) on the backend.
    - Store tokens in memory, context, or secure cookies on the frontend.
    - Attach tokens to API requests as needed.

5. **Deployment**
    - Serve the React build files from the backend (optional), or deploy frontend and backend separately.
    - Update API URLs as needed for production.

### Summary

- Build API endpoints in your backend (Node.js, Django, etc.).
- Use HTTP requests in React to interact with the backend.
- Handle CORS and authentication as needed.
- Deploy both parts and connect via API endpoints.


## 98. What are some common patterns for managing side effects in React applications?

Managing side effects in React is crucial for predictable, maintainable, and bug-free applications. Here are some common patterns:

### 1. `useEffect` Hook

- **Purpose:** Handles most side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, timers, DOM manipulation).
- **Pattern:** Place side-effect logic inside `useEffect`. Use the cleanup function to remove subscriptions or timers.
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
        // Side effect (e.g., fetch data)
        return () => {
            // Cleanup (e.g., clear interval)
        };
    }, [dependencies]);
    ```

### 2. Custom Hooks

- **Purpose:** Encapsulate and reuse side-effect logic across components.
- **Pattern:** Create a function starting with `use` that uses hooks internally.
    ```jsx
    function useFetch(url) {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);
        useEffect(() => {
            fetch(url).then(res => res.json()).then(setData);
        }, [url]);
        return data;
    }
    ```

### 3. Separation of Effects

- **Purpose:** Keep unrelated effects in separate `useEffect` calls for clarity and correct dependency management.
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => { /* fetch data */ }, [id]);
    useEffect(() => { /* subscribe to events */ }, []);
    ```

### 4. Effect Cleanup

- **Purpose:** Prevent memory leaks by cleaning up subscriptions, timers, or listeners.
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
        const id = setInterval(...);
        return () => clearInterval(id);
    }, []);
    ```

### 5. Using External Libraries

- **Purpose:** Manage complex side effects (async flows, subscriptions) with libraries like Redux middleware (`redux-thunk`, `redux-saga`), React Query, or SWR.
- **Pattern:** Delegate data fetching, caching, and synchronization to these libraries for better separation of concerns.

### 6. Dependency Management

- **Purpose:** Ensure effects run only when necessary by specifying correct dependencies in the dependency array.
- **Pattern:** Always include all referenced variables and functions in the dependency array, or use ESLint's hooks plugin to enforce this.

### 7. Avoiding Side Effects in Render

- **Purpose:** Never perform side effects directly in the render body; always use hooks or lifecycle methods.

**Summary:**  
Use `useEffect` and custom hooks for most side effects, separate unrelated effects, always clean up resources, and leverage external libraries for complex scenarios. Proper dependency management and cleanup are essential for robust React applications.



## 99. Explain the role of Redux middleware and provide examples of some popular middleware.

### What is Redux Middleware?

Redux middleware is a function that sits between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. Middleware can intercept, modify, delay, or log actions, and is commonly used to handle side effects such as asynchronous API calls, logging, or analytics.

### Role of Middleware

- **Enhance Dispatch:** Middleware can intercept actions before they reach the reducer, allowing you to perform additional logic or side effects.
- **Async Logic:** Enables dispatching functions (thunks), promises, or observables for handling asynchronous operations.
- **Logging and Debugging:** Middleware can log actions and state changes for easier debugging.
- **Extensibility:** Middleware provides a flexible way to extend Redux without modifying the core logic.

### Popular Redux Middleware Examples

1. **redux-thunk**
    - Allows action creators to return functions (thunks) instead of plain objects.
    - Enables async logic (e.g., API calls) inside action creators.
    - Example:
      ```js
      // Action creator with redux-thunk
      export const fetchData = () => async (dispatch) => {
            dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });
            try {
                 const res = await fetch('/api/data');
                 const data = await res.json();
                 dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });
            } catch (err) {
                 dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error: err });
            }
      };
      ```

2. **redux-saga**
    - Uses generator functions to manage complex async flows and side effects.
    - Good for orchestrating multiple actions, background tasks, and advanced async logic.
    - Example:
      ```js
      import { call, put, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

      function* fetchDataSaga() {
            try {
                 const res = yield call(fetch, '/api/data');
                 const data = yield res.json();
                 yield put({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });
            } catch (err) {
                 yield put({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error: err });
            }
      }

      function* rootSaga() {
            yield takeEvery('FETCH_START', fetchDataSaga);
      }
      ```

3. **redux-logger**
    - Logs every action and the resulting state to the console.
    - Useful for debugging and development.
    - Example:
      ```js
      import { createLogger } from 'redux-logger';
      const logger = createLogger();
      // Add logger to middleware array when creating the store
      ```

4. **redux-promise**
    - Allows you to dispatch promises as actions.
    - Middleware automatically dispatches actions for pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.

5. **redux-observable**
    - Uses RxJS observables to handle async actions as streams.
    - Suitable for complex async flows and real-time data.

### Summary

Redux middleware extends the store’s capabilities, enabling async logic, logging, and more. Popular middleware includes redux-thunk (async functions), redux-saga (generators), redux-logger (logging), and redux-observable (RxJS streams).


## 100. Describe the differences between server-side rendering (SSR), client-side rendering (CSR), and static site generation (SSG) in the context of React.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

- **What:** React components are rendered to HTML on the server for each request. The server sends the fully rendered HTML to the browser, which then hydrates the page to make it interactive.
- **How:** Implemented using frameworks like Next.js (`getServerSideProps`) or custom setups with `ReactDOMServer`.
- **Pros:** Fast initial load, better SEO, content is visible before JavaScript loads.
- **Cons:** Higher server load, slower navigation between pages (unless combined with client-side routing).

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

- **What:** The browser downloads a minimal HTML shell and JavaScript bundle. React renders the UI in the browser after JavaScript loads.
- **How:** Standard Create React App, Vite, or similar setups.
- **Pros:** Fast navigation after initial load, less server work, good for web apps with dynamic content.
- **Cons:** Slower first paint, poor SEO unless additional techniques (like pre-rendering) are used.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

- **What:** React components are rendered to HTML at build time, producing static HTML files for each page. These files are served directly by a CDN or web server.
- **How:** Frameworks like Next.js (`getStaticProps`), Gatsby, or Astro.
- **Pros:** Fastest possible load times, excellent SEO, low server cost, highly cacheable.
- **Cons:** Content is only as fresh as the last build; not ideal for highly dynamic or personalized pages.

### Comparison Table

| Feature         | SSR                        | CSR                        | SSG                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Initial Render  | Server                     | Client                     | Build time (static files)  |
| SEO             | Excellent                  | Poor (without extra work)  | Excellent                  |
| Performance     | Fast first load, slower nav| Slow first load, fast nav  | Fastest load, fast nav     |
| Use Case        | Dynamic, personalized pages| Web apps, dashboards       | Blogs, docs, marketing     |
| Example         | Next.js (SSR)              | Create React App, Vite     | Next.js (SSG), Gatsby      |

**Summary:**  
- **SSR:** Renders on the server per request—great for dynamic, SEO-critical pages.
- **CSR:** Renders in the browser—best for interactive apps, but slower initial load.
- **SSG:** Renders at build time—ideal for static content, fastest performance, and best SEO for non-dynamic sites.


## 101. What are some techniques for optimizing the rendering performance of React applications?

Optimizing rendering performance in React is crucial for building fast, responsive apps. Here are some effective techniques:

### 1. Memoization

- **`React.memo`**: Wrap functional components to prevent re-renders when props haven't changed.
    ```jsx
    const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) { ... });
    ```
- **`useMemo`**: Memoize expensive computed values.
    ```jsx
    const result = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
    ```
- **`useCallback`**: Memoize functions to avoid unnecessary re-creations.
    ```jsx
    const handleClick = useCallback(() => { ... }, [deps]);
    ```

### 2. Pure Components

- Use `React.PureComponent` for class components to enable shallow prop/state comparison and skip unnecessary renders.

### 3. Avoid Inline Functions and Objects in JSX

- Define functions and objects outside the render or memoize them to prevent new references on each render, which can trigger child re-renders.

### 4. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

- Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components only when needed, reducing initial bundle size.

### 5. Virtualization/Windowing

- Render only visible items in large lists using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.

### 6. Optimize Context Usage

- Split context providers to minimize re-renders of all consumers when only part of the context changes.

### 7. Debounce or Throttle Expensive Operations

- Debounce input handlers (e.g., search filters) to reduce the frequency of updates and re-renders.

### 8. Use Production Builds

- Always deploy production builds (`npm run build`) for optimized code and smaller bundles.

### 9. Profile and Analyze

- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify slow components and unnecessary renders.

**Summary:**  
Combine memoization, pure components, code splitting, virtualization, and careful context usage to optimize rendering performance in React applications. Always profile your app to target real bottlenecks.

## 102. How do you handle internationalization (i18n) in React applications?

Internationalization (i18n) in React involves designing your app to support multiple languages and regional formats. This typically includes translating UI text, formatting dates/numbers, and handling right-to-left (RTL) layouts.

### Common Approaches

1. **Using i18n Libraries**
    - **react-i18next:** The most popular library for React i18n. It provides hooks, components, and utilities for translation, language switching, and interpolation.
    - **FormatJS / react-intl:** Another robust solution for message formatting and locale-aware formatting.

2. **Basic Example with react-i18next**

    **Installation:**
    ```bash
    npm install react-i18next i18next
    ```

    **Setup:**
    ```jsx
    // i18n.js
    import i18n from 'i18next';
    import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';

    i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
      resources: {
         en: { translation: { welcome: "Welcome" } },
         fr: { translation: { welcome: "Bienvenue" } },
      },
      lng: "en",
      fallbackLng: "en",
      interpolation: { escapeValue: false },
    });

    export default i18n;
    ```

    **Usage in Components:**
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
    import './i18n';

    function Welcome() {
      const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();
      return (
         <div>
            <p>{t('welcome')}</p>
            <button onClick={() => i18n.changeLanguage('fr')}>Français</button>
            <button onClick={() => i18n.changeLanguage('en')}>English</button>
         </div>
      );
    }

    export default Welcome;
    ```

3. **Formatting Dates and Numbers**
    - Use libraries like `Intl.DateTimeFormat` or `react-intl` for locale-aware formatting.

4. **Handling RTL Languages**
    - Adjust CSS and layout direction based on the current language (e.g., `dir="rtl"` for Arabic/Hebrew).

### Best Practices

- Store translations in separate JSON files.
- Use keys for all translatable text.
- Support dynamic language switching.
- Test with different locales and RTL layouts.

**Summary:**  
Handle i18n in React using libraries like react-i18next or react-intl for translations, formatting, and language switching. Structure your app to load translations dynamically and support locale-specific formatting and layouts.


## 103. Explain the concept of tree shaking in the context of React and its benefits.

### What is Tree Shaking?

Tree shaking is a build optimization technique used to eliminate unused code from JavaScript bundles. In the context of React, tree shaking removes unused exports from libraries (including React itself and third-party packages), resulting in smaller and more efficient bundles.

### How Does Tree Shaking Work?

- Modern bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, and Vite analyze ES module (`import`/`export`) syntax to determine which parts of the code are actually used.
- Unused exports (functions, components, utilities) are excluded from the final bundle.
- This process relies on static analysis, so only code that can be determined as unused at build time is removed.

### Benefits in React Applications

- **Smaller Bundle Size:** Only the code you use is included, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.
- **Faster Load Times:** Smaller bundles mean faster downloads and quicker initial page loads.
- **Better Performance:** Less code to parse and execute improves runtime performance.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Encourages modular code and helps identify dead code.

### Example

If you import only specific functions or components from a library:

```js
import { Button } from 'my-ui-library';
// Only Button is included in the bundle if tree shaking is enabled.
```

Unused components from `my-ui-library` are excluded from the final build.

### How to Enable Tree Shaking

- Use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`).
- Build your app in production mode with a modern bundler (Webpack, Vite, Rollup).
- Avoid using CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`), as it is not tree-shakeable.

**Summary:**  
Tree shaking in React removes unused code from your bundles, leading to smaller, faster, and more efficient applications. It is enabled by default in most modern React build setups.


## 104. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using TypeScript with React?

### Advantages

1. **Static Type Checking:**  
    TypeScript catches type errors at compile time, reducing runtime bugs and improving code reliability.

2. **Better Developer Experience:**  
    Enhanced autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring support in editors, leading to faster and safer development.

3. **Self-Documenting Code:**  
    Types serve as documentation, making it easier to understand component props, state, and APIs.

4. **Early Error Detection:**  
    Detects issues before running the code, especially in large codebases or during refactoring.

5. **Improved Collaboration:**  
    Teams can work more efficiently with clear contracts for components and functions.

6. **Easier Refactoring:**  
    Type safety makes large-scale refactoring safer and more predictable.

7. **Third-Party Type Definitions:**  
    Many React libraries provide TypeScript types, improving integration and reducing guesswork.

### Disadvantages

1. **Learning Curve:**  
    Developers unfamiliar with TypeScript or static typing may need time to adapt.

2. **Increased Complexity:**  
    Type definitions and generics can add verbosity and complexity, especially for advanced patterns.

3. **Setup and Configuration:**  
    Initial setup (tsconfig, type definitions) can be more involved compared to plain JavaScript.

4. **Third-Party Type Gaps:**  
    Some libraries may lack or have incomplete type definitions, requiring manual typing or workarounds.

5. **Longer Build Times:**  
    Type checking can slightly increase build and compilation times, especially in large projects.

### Summary

Using TypeScript with React improves code safety, maintainability, and developer experience, but introduces additional complexity and a learning curve. It is widely adopted for medium to large projects where these benefits outweigh the drawbacks.


## 105. Describe the differences between React context and Redux for managing global state.

### React Context

- **Purpose:** Designed for sharing simple, infrequently changing global data (e.g., theme, locale, authenticated user) across the component tree without prop drilling.
- **API:** Uses `createContext`, `Provider`, and `useContext` hook.
- **Boilerplate:** Minimal setup; built into React.
- **Performance:** Frequent updates to context values can cause all consuming components to re-render, which may impact performance in large apps.
- **Features:** No built-in middleware, devtools, or advanced state logic; best for moderate, static, or configuration data.
- **Best Use Case:** Small to medium apps, or for sharing simple global state.

### Redux

- **Purpose:** External library for predictable, centralized state management, especially in large or complex apps with frequently changing or shared state.
- **API:** Uses a single store, actions, reducers, and dispatch; integrates with React via `react-redux`.
- **Boilerplate:** More setup and code structure (though Redux Toolkit reduces this).
- **Performance:** Fine-grained control over state updates; selectors and memoization help optimize re-renders.
- **Features:** Middleware support (e.g., for async logic), powerful devtools, time-travel debugging, and advanced patterns.
- **Best Use Case:** Large-scale apps, complex state logic, or when you need advanced debugging and middleware.

### Comparison Table

| Feature           | React Context                | Redux                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Type              | Built-in React API           | External library               |
| Setup             | Minimal                      | More involved                  |
| State Location    | Multiple contexts allowed    | Single global store            |
| Boilerplate       | Low                          | Higher (less with Toolkit)     |
| Middleware        | No                           | Yes (e.g., redux-thunk, saga)  |
| DevTools          | Basic                        | Advanced                       |
| Performance       | Can cause over-rendering     | Optimized with selectors       |
| Use Case          | Simple/moderate global state | Complex, shared, or large state|

**Summary:**  
Use React context for simple, static global data and Redux for complex, frequently updated, or large-scale state management with advanced features.

## 106. How do you test React components and applications? What are some popular testing libraries and frameworks?

### How do you test React components?

Testing React components involves verifying that they render correctly, handle user interactions, manage state, and integrate with other components or APIs as expected. The main types of tests are:

- **Unit tests:** Test individual components or functions in isolation.
- **Integration tests:** Test how multiple components work together.
- **End-to-end (E2E) tests:** Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective.

### Popular Testing Libraries and Frameworks

1. **Jest**
    - The default test runner for React projects (especially Create React App).
    - Provides assertions, mocking, and snapshot testing.
    - Runs tests in parallel for speed.

2. **React Testing Library (RTL)**
    - Encourages testing components from the user's perspective.
    - Provides utilities to render components and query the DOM by text, label, or role.
    - Works seamlessly with Jest.

    **Example:**
    ```jsx
    import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
    import Counter from './Counter';

    test('increments counter on button click', () => {
      render(<Counter />);
      fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/Increment/i));
      expect(screen.getByText(/Count: 1/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

3. **Enzyme** (legacy)
    - Developed by Airbnb for testing React components.
    - Allows shallow, mount, and static rendering.
    - Less recommended for new projects; RTL is preferred.

4. **Cypress**
    - End-to-end testing framework for simulating real user interactions in the browser.
    - Useful for testing full application flows.

5. **Playwright / Puppeteer**
    - Browser automation tools for E2E testing.
    - Can be used to test React apps in real browsers.

### Best Practices

- Test components as users would interact with them (RTL approach).
- Use Jest for running and organizing tests.
- Use E2E tools like Cypress for full user journey tests.
- Mock APIs and dependencies as needed for isolation.

**Summary:**  
Test React components using Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, and Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests. Focus on testing user interactions and component behavior, not implementation details.


## 107. Explain the concept of pure components in React and how they differ from regular components.

### What is a Pure Component in React?

A **pure component** is a component that renders the same output for the same props and state. In React, `React.PureComponent` (for class components) and `React.memo` (for functional components) implement a shallow comparison of props and state to determine if a re-render is necessary.

### How Do Pure Components Work?

- **Shallow Comparison:** Pure components automatically compare current and next props/state. If there are no changes, React skips the re-render.
- **Optimization:** This reduces unnecessary renders, improving performance, especially in components that receive frequently updating props.

### Difference Between Pure and Regular Components

| Aspect                | Regular Component (`Component`) | Pure Component (`PureComponent`/`React.memo`) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Re-render Behavior    | Always re-renders on parent update or state/props change | Only re-renders if shallow comparison detects a change |
| Comparison Logic      | No automatic comparison         | Shallow comparison of props and state         |
| Use Case              | Default for most components     | Performance optimization for components with stable props/state |

### Example

**Class Component:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';

class RegularComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
    }
}

class PureComp extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
    }
}
```

**Functional Component:**
```jsx
const PureFunc = React.memo(function PureFunc({ value }) {
    return <div>{value}</div>;
});
```

### When to Use Pure Components

- When your component renders the same output for the same props/state.
- To optimize performance in components that receive frequently updating but unchanged props.

**Summary:**  
Pure components prevent unnecessary re-renders by performing a shallow comparison of props and state, unlike regular components which always re-render. Use them to optimize performance in React applications.


## 108. What are some best practices for structuring and organizing React code in a large-scale application?

Organizing React code effectively is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration in large-scale applications. Here are some best practices:

### 1. Use a Feature-Based Folder Structure

Organize files by feature or domain rather than by type. This keeps related components, hooks, styles, and tests together.

```
src/
    features/
        auth/
            AuthPage.jsx
            authSlice.js
            hooks.js
            AuthForm.module.css
            AuthPage.test.jsx
        dashboard/
            Dashboard.jsx
            dashboardSlice.js
            hooks.js
            Dashboard.module.css
            Dashboard.test.jsx
    components/
        Button.jsx
        Modal.jsx
    utils/
        api.js
        formatDate.js
```

### 2. Keep Components Small and Focused

- Each component should do one thing well.
- Break down large components into smaller, reusable pieces.

### 3. Use Index Files for Barrel Exports

Export modules from `index.js`/`index.ts` files to simplify imports:

```js
// features/auth/index.js
export { default as AuthPage } from './AuthPage';
export * from './hooks';
```

### 4. Co-locate Styles and Tests

Place CSS Modules, styles, and tests next to their components for easier maintenance.

### 5. Separate UI and Logic

- Use container/presenter (smart/dumb) component patterns or custom hooks to separate business logic from UI.
- Example: `useUserData.js` for fetching data, `UserProfile.jsx` for rendering.

### 6. Use Absolute Imports

Configure your bundler or `jsconfig.json`/`tsconfig.json` to allow absolute imports (e.g., `import Button from 'components/Button'`).

### 7. Consistent Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for components and camelCase for functions/variables.
- Name files after the component they export.

### 8. Modularize State Management

- Use Context, Redux slices, or Zustand stores per feature.
- Avoid a single, monolithic global store.

### 9. Document and Enforce Patterns

- Use linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and code reviews to enforce consistency.
- Document folder structure and conventions in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or similar.

### 10. Avoid Deep Nesting

- Limit folder nesting to keep imports and navigation simple.

**Summary:**  
Structure React code by feature, keep components small, co-locate related files, separate logic from UI, use absolute imports, and enforce consistent conventions. This leads to scalable, maintainable, and collaborative large-scale React applications.

## 109. What is profiling and how is it done in React?

### What is Profiling?

Profiling is the process of measuring the performance of your React application, specifically how components render and update. It helps identify slow components, unnecessary re-renders, and performance bottlenecks, enabling you to optimize your app for better user experience.

### How is Profiling Done in React?

React provides built-in tools for profiling:

#### 1. **React DevTools Profiler**

- **Installation:**  
    Install the [React DevTools browser extension](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).
- **Usage:**  
    - Open your app in the browser.
    - Go to the "⚛️ Profiler" tab in DevTools.
    - Click "Record" and interact with your app.
    - Stop recording to see a flamegraph and ranked chart of component renders, durations, and why each component rendered.

#### 2. **Profiling in Production**

- You can enable profiling in production builds using the `react-dom/profiling` package and analyze the output with tools like [react-profiler](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) or custom scripts.

#### 3. **Programmatic Profiling**

- Use the `<Profiler>` component from React to measure rendering performance of specific parts of your app:

    ```jsx
    import React, { Profiler } from 'react';

    function onRenderCallback(
        id, phase, actualDuration, baseDuration, startTime, commitTime, interactions
    ) {
        console.log({ id, phase, actualDuration });
    }

    function App() {
        return (
            <Profiler id="MyComponent" onRender={onRenderCallback}>
                <MyComponent />
            </Profiler>
        );
    }
    ```

### What Can You Learn from Profiling?

- Which components are slow to render.
- How often components re-render and why.
- The impact of state or prop changes on rendering performance.

### Summary

Profiling in React is done using React DevTools Profiler or the `<Profiler>` API to measure and analyze component rendering performance. This helps you find and fix performance issues in your application.

## 110. What is Fragments in React? Explain with example.

### What are Fragments in React?

Fragments in React allow you to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This is useful when a component needs to return multiple sibling elements, but you don't want to wrap them in an unnecessary `<div>` or other container.

### Why use Fragments?

- **Avoid extra DOM nodes:** Keeps the rendered HTML clean and prevents unwanted wrappers that can affect styling or layout.
- **Semantic markup:** Maintains the correct HTML structure, especially in tables or lists.

### How to use Fragments

You can use `<React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>` or the shorthand `<>...</>`.

#### Example with `<React.Fragment>`:

```jsx
function TableRow() {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Age</td>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}
```

#### Example with shorthand syntax:

```jsx
function TableRow() {
    return (
        <>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Age</td>
        </>
    );
}
```

### Key Points

- Fragments can take a `key` prop when mapping lists.
- The shorthand `<>...</>` cannot accept props.

**Summary:**  
Fragments let you return multiple elements from a component without adding extra nodes to the DOM, keeping your markup clean and efficient.



## 111. Explain Styling Techniques – CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS 4.0, clsx 2.1, scalable patterns

### CSS Modules

**CSS Modules** provide locally scoped CSS by default. When you import a `.module.css` file, class names are automatically scoped to the component, preventing global style conflicts.

**Example:**
```css
/* Button.module.css */
.button {
    background: #007bff;
    color: white;
}
```
```jsx
import styles from './Button.module.css';

function Button() {
    return <button className={styles.button}>Click Me</button>;
}
```
- Use for modular, reusable components.
- No global class name collisions.

---

### Tailwind CSS 4.0

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework. Version 4.0 brings improved performance and new utilities. You compose styles directly in your JSX using class names.

**Example:**
```jsx
function Card() {
    return (
        <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-4">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Title</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">Content</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```
- Rapid prototyping and consistent design.
- Highly customizable via config.
- No custom class names needed.

---

### clsx 2.1

**clsx** is a tiny utility for conditionally joining classNames. Version 2.1 supports improved type safety and performance.

**Example:**
```jsx
import clsx from 'clsx';

function Alert({ type }) {
    return (
        <div className={clsx(
            'p-4 rounded',
            type === 'error' && 'bg-red-100 text-red-700',
            type === 'success' && 'bg-green-100 text-green-700'
        )}>
            {type === 'error' ? 'Error!' : 'Success!'}
        </div>
    );
}
```
- Cleanly manage conditional classes.
- Works well with Tailwind and CSS Modules.

---

### Scalable Patterns

- **Co-locate styles:** Keep CSS files next to components.
- **Use CSS Modules for local styles, Tailwind for utilities.**
- **Combine with clsx** for dynamic class management.
- **Adopt a consistent naming convention** and folder structure.
- **Leverage design tokens/configs** for theme consistency.
- **Avoid global styles** except for resets and base typography.

**Summary:**  
Combine CSS Modules for local styles, Tailwind CSS for utility classes, and clsx for conditional class management. Organize styles by feature/component for scalability and maintainability.



## 112. Explain Routing – Nested routes, useParams, useSearchParams, route guards

### Nested Routes

Nested routes allow you to render child components within parent routes, creating a hierarchical navigation structure. In React Router (v6+), you define nested `<Route>` elements inside a parent `<Route>`, and use the `<Outlet />` component to render child routes.

**Example:**
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Outlet, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Dashboard() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Dashboard</h2>
            <nav>
                <Link to="profile">Profile</Link>
                <Link to="settings">Settings</Link>
            </nav>
            <Outlet />
        </div>
    );
}

function Profile() { return <div>Profile Page</div>; }
function Settings() { return <div>Settings Page</div>; }

function App() {
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Routes>
                <Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
                    <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
                    <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
                </Route>
            </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>
    );
}
```
- `Outlet` renders the matched child route inside `Dashboard`.

---

### useParams

The `useParams` hook lets you access dynamic parameters from the URL.

**Example:**
```jsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function User() {
    const { userId } = useParams();
    return <div>User ID: {userId}</div>;
}

// Route: <Route path="user/:userId" element={<User />} />
```
- Visiting `/user/42` renders `User ID: 42`.

---

### useSearchParams

The `useSearchParams` hook provides access to query string parameters.

**Example:**
```jsx
import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function SearchPage() {
    const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
    const query = searchParams.get('q');
    return <div>Search query: {query}</div>;
}

// URL: /search?q=react
```
- Displays `Search query: react`.

---

### Route Guards (Protected Routes)

Route guards restrict access to certain routes based on authentication or other conditions. Implement a wrapper component that checks the condition and redirects if necessary.

**Example:**
```jsx
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProtectedRoute({ isAuthenticated, children }) {
    return isAuthenticated ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
}

// Usage:
// <Route path="/dashboard" element={<ProtectedRoute isAuthenticated={userLoggedIn}><Dashboard /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```
- If `isAuthenticated` is false, redirects to `/login`.

---

**Summary:**  
- **Nested routes** enable hierarchical navigation with `<Outlet />`.
- **useParams** extracts dynamic URL segments.
- **useSearchParams** reads and sets query parameters.
- **Route guards** protect routes by conditionally rendering or redirecting based on authentication or other logic.


## 113. Explain Error Handling – Error boundaries, debugging, graceful fallbacks

### Error Boundaries

Error boundaries are special React class components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app. They implement either `static getDerivedStateFromError` or `componentDidCatch`.

**Example:**
```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
    }
    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        return { hasError: true };
    }
    componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        // Log error to an error reporting service
        console.error(error, info);
    }
    render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
            return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
    }
}
```
Wrap components with `<ErrorBoundary>` to catch errors and show a fallback UI.

---

### Debugging

- **React DevTools:** Inspect component state, props, and hooks.
- **Console Logging:** Use `console.error`, `console.warn`, or custom logging in `componentDidCatch` or `useEffect`.
- **Source Maps:** Ensure source maps are enabled for readable stack traces.
- **Error Reporting:** Integrate with services like Sentry or LogRocket for error tracking in production.

---

### Graceful Fallbacks

- **Fallback UI:** Show user-friendly messages or alternative content when errors occur.
- **Retry Logic:** Allow users to retry failed actions (e.g., reload data).
- **Boundary Placement:** Place error boundaries around critical sections (e.g., routes, widgets) to isolate failures.
- **Loading and Empty States:** Handle loading, error, and empty data states in UI components.

**Summary:**  
Use error boundaries to catch rendering errors and display fallback UIs, leverage debugging tools for diagnosis, and provide graceful fallbacks to maintain a good user experience even when errors occur.

## 114. Explain global state management in React: Context API, Redux Toolkit, and Zustand

### Context API

- **What:** Built-in React feature for sharing global data (e.g., theme, user) across the component tree without prop drilling.
- **How:** Create a context with `createContext`, provide a value with `Provider`, and consume it with `useContext`.
- **Use Case:** Simple or moderate global state, infrequently changing data.
- **Example:**
    ```jsx
    const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
    function App() {
        return (
            <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
                <Toolbar />
            </ThemeContext.Provider>
        );
    }
    function Toolbar() {
        const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
        return <div>Theme: {theme}</div>;
    }
    ```
- **Pros:** No external dependencies, minimal setup.
- **Cons:** Frequent updates can cause all consumers to re-render; not ideal for large or complex state.

---

### Redux Toolkit

- **What:** Official, modern Redux toolset for scalable, predictable state management.
- **How:** Centralizes state in a single store, uses "slices" for modular logic, and provides utilities for reducers, actions, and async logic.
- **Use Case:** Large-scale apps, complex or frequently updated global state, advanced debugging/middleware needs.
- **Example:**
    ```js
    // store.js
    import { configureStore, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    const counterSlice = createSlice({
        name: 'counter',
        initialState: { value: 0 },
        reducers: {
            increment: state => { state.value += 1; },
        },
    });
    export const { increment } = counterSlice.actions;
    export default configureStore({ reducer: { counter: counterSlice.reducer } });
    ```
    ```jsx
    // Counter.js
    import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
    import { increment } from './store';
    function Counter() {
        const value = useSelector(state => state.counter.value);
        const dispatch = useDispatch();
        return <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>{value}</button>;
    }
    ```
- **Pros:** Predictable, scalable, powerful devtools, middleware support.
- **Cons:** More setup than Context or Zustand (though much less than classic Redux).

---

### Zustand

- **What:** Lightweight, minimalistic state management library using hooks and a simple store.
- **How:** Create a store with `create`, use hooks to read/update state anywhere.
- **Use Case:** Small to medium apps, local or global state, when you want simplicity and minimal boilerplate.
- **Example:**
    ```js
    import create from 'zustand';
    const useStore = create(set => ({
        count: 0,
        increment: () => set(state => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
    }));
    ```
    ```jsx
    function Counter() {
        const { count, increment } = useStore();
        return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;
    }
    ```
- **Pros:** Extremely simple API, minimal re-renders, no provider needed, works with React Server Components.
- **Cons:** Fewer built-in devtools/middleware than Redux, less structure for very large apps.

---

**Summary Table:**

| Solution        | Setup      | Boilerplate | Performance | Best For                        |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Context API     | Built-in   | Low         | OK          | Simple/moderate global state     |
| Redux Toolkit   | External   | Moderate    | High        | Large/complex shared state       |
| Zustand         | External   | Very Low    | High        | Simple/global/local state, rapid dev |

**Summary:**  
Use Context API for simple global data, Redux Toolkit for large-scale or complex state, and Zustand for minimal, scalable state management with a hook-based API.
